buffalo is reading this where did you people get thatwoman who sang the anthems we had to turn down the volume the flyers defense started out the game showing everybody why the flyers havebeen shutting teams out lately by holding the sabres to only shots in thefirst period they then showed everybody why they will be playing golf sundaywhen they gave up shots in the last two periods maybe tommy told them thathe was getting bored back there mark recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it afterbuffalo won the faceoff and dumped tommy wrapped the puck around the boardsto eric way up on his left eric dropped it to galley and he sent it aheadto recchi steaming out of the zone mark skated into the center circle passedthe puck to himself through the legs of richard smehlik skated around him andin on fuhr smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with hisstick recchi drifted right drifted back left and slid the puck back to theright past fuhr for flyers lead at it was so beautiful eric andgarry should turn down their assists the flyers kept the pressure on fuhr for while after that but he was strongand kept the flyers from doing further damage the game then became for while the sabres got the first chance on the power play whenterry carkner took boarding minor at for crunching dale hawerchuk intothe boards in the flyers zone lafontaine got the only scoring chance and nota terribly good one as the flyers smothered the sabres power play mogilny gota post after it was over the th consecutive penalty kill for the flyers keith carney took holding penalty at for taking down mark recchi togive the flyers power play the best penalty killing team in the leaguedidnt allow the flyers shot on goal although the flyers did create agood scoring chance for lindros who partially fanned on his shot towardsthe end of the period the play started going end to end but everybody keptmissing the net greg hawgood took an interference penalty at to givethe sabres another power play but they couldnt get anything going and thefans expressed their displeasure particularly when they iced the puck shotswere buffalo after the flyers had led at one point mike emrick interviewed flyers president jay snider between periods jay wasdisappointed to not make the playoffs but not discouraged this was considereda rebuilding year after the trade and he seemed very happy with the way theseason went when asked if he agonized over the trade he said that it wasruss farwells trade and not his that it only was an issue for him and edsnider as far as the money but yes there was some agonizing and theyd doit all over again when asked how the coaching situation would be handled fornext year he said that its russ call and russ will evaluate things at theend of the season he feels that theyre years away from shot at the cup he expects to get into the playoffs next year have shot at division titlethe following year and shot at the finals the year after that this basedon the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer hes very happy with the re alignment he called it outstanding happy withthe current expansion feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unfluxof europeans but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable seemed to like the idea of playing in the olympics booo but said that therewas definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen infour years if there was consensus the sabres gave the flyers their second power play of the game when brad maytook tripping penalty at of the second the flyers had little troublegetting started but eventually did hawgood took pass as he was movingthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to eklund just outside the sabresblue line along the right boards eklund carried into the zone nad passedacross to dineen who tried one timer from between the blue line and thetop of the left circle he half fanned on it and sent the puck the slot fuhr didnt know where it was though and hawgood won therace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at then mogilny on breakaway he slipped through two flyers at the blue lineand went in on soderstrom he went with the backhander but soderstrom wasall over it the flyers then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them viacheslav butsayev took double minor for roughing and high sticking whenbarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor then according to gary dornhoefertook dive to get the other there was no video at the sabres coudlntget started ryan mcgill poked at the puck just after sabre carried into theflyers zone and after bunch of people poked at it dineen emerged with it andheaded the other way it started out on but brindamour hustled ahead tomake it on and back off the defenseman dineen let it rip from the topof the right circle to make it flyers at that was all for fuhr johnmuckler sent in dominik hasek to take over but the sabres still had lots of power play time again they took some time tojust get into the flyers zone and when they finally did the flyers were allover them boos began to ring through the building but they finally got on an ugly goal smehlik took shot from the top of the zone thatmissed and kicked out to hawerchuk in the slot hawerchuk tried backhander ashe skated towards the goal line to the right as galley dove down to block it mistake he should have let soderstrom handle the backhander and worriedabout the rebound or barnaby who was camped behind the goal line rightnext to the net well the rebound dropped right next to soderstrom andmistake galley just laid there and watched barnaby get three hacks at thepuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie he didnt even swing hisstick out to try and knock the puck away with the goal at two streaksend for the flyers of shutout hockey and straight penalty kills lindros put them right back on the power play at with high stickingminor think it was barnaby again this time the sabres were able to getset up quickly but couldnt get too much quality on goal the sabres continuedto keep the puck in the flyers end for while after the power play ended things evetually settled down but then the other very bad penalty mcgillallowed barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before afaceoff the gloves were dropped and mcgill started pounding the crap out ofhim but during the fight he gave barnaby head butt with his helmet andthat meant match penalty for slashing fighting and for the major minutes of power play time for the sabres at barnaby only got the flyers were keeping them at bay for while but there was only so longthey could do that after couple of good sabre chances audette handed toledyard at the point and ledyard sent drive that was knocked down bysoderstrom lafontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side ofthe net and knocked it over to randy wood at the right soderstrom hadmoved over to play lafontaine and since yushkevich and carkner were wavingat the puck instead of picking up men wood just slid it into the empty netat to close the flyers lead to lafontaine was actually trying toput it on net but half fanned on it and got break the flyers then got some shorthanded pressure in the sabres zone but hasekwas strong finally it was keith carney passing ahead to hawerchuk into theneutral zone and hawerchuk sent good backhand pass to mogilny at the flyersblue line another mini breakaway for mogilny he elected to shoot from theleft circle and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at for his th of the season ironically the youth hockey tip betweenthe st and second period was tommy soderstrom talking about cutting offangles that was all in the nd shots were sabres into the rd period and pelle eklund blew golden opportunity to get theflyers the lead back on acton with the puck he dropped to eklund inthe slot and eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle untilhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from when he finally did shoot hehit the far post that was still during the carryover power play time than an incredible almost goal randy wood skated around recchi and into soderstrom soderstrom goes down wood pokes the puck undersoderstrom and black object hits the back of the net red light comes on horn sounds crowd cheers but up to the video replay booth for some strangereason and in the meantime emrick and dornhoefer try to figure out what theycould be reviewing well it turns out that it was the taped up stick bladethat went into the net not the puck emrick mentions that one of the criteriafor scoring goal is that the puck must go into the net dave hannan then took out recchi and got holding minor at the flyerscould not get anything going at all they finally got set up way through but were kept on the perimeter as time ran out beranek stripped the puckfrom sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it acrossto eklund at the top of the left circle eklund saw dineen heading at the netjust inside the right circle and passed through to him dineen fumbled the pass but twice directed it at hasek and eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncingpuck over the goalie for his th at flyers but the sabres came right back lafontaine picked up the puck in his offensiveleft corner and slid it to bob erry behind the flyers net erry started to skateout but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net mogilny flewin skated around and stuffed it through soderstroms hole for his th at to tie the game at then hawerchuk took retaliatory roughing penalty at the flyers set upin the sabres zone and stayed there off faceoff high in the sabres zone inthe middle while brindamour wrestled for the puck dineen snuck through theline and wristed perfect shot low to haseks glove side at play started to go back and forth until hawgood took roughing penalty at the flyers dumped the puck into the sabres zone brindamour and ledyard wentafter it and rod got the puck he backed away from the right boards skatedto the right faceoff dot and passed between his legs to dineen crashingthrough the slot all by himself dineen waited patiently and lifted it overthe blocker of hasek for flyers lead at rd hat trick of the seasonfor dineen th of his career nd shorthanded goal of the game for him thof the season then carney took tripping penalty at to kill the rest of the sabrespower play not much action on the on and the sabres got most of thechances on the flyers resulting power play play went end to end for quite while after that and both goalies had tomake some big saves the sabres werent able to pull hasek as time was running out as the flyers wouldnt allow any consistant possession for the sabres finally as time was running out ken sutton misplayed the puck in his own leftcorner and brindamour stripped it away from him he pulled away and founddineen on the other side of the left circle and dineen found acton at theright of hasek he slid the puck between two sabres defenders and actonchipped it back to the far side of hasek for his th of the season at on his th birthday that was all the scoring shots were buffalo and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before thegame so another strong game from tommy soderstrom who hadnt been tested muchin his last couple of starts kevin dineen has career high point night unless he had better night earlier in the season but dont think so the flyers longest winning streak in years goals for only againstwith three shutouts eric lindros is th in league with even strength goalsdespite missing games with injury points out of th clinched th placesince the rangers lose the tie breaker couple misc notes forget the mike keenan rumors there will be press conference tommorrow toannounce that he will be head coach of the new york rangers next year in the last notes mentioned that garry galley won the barry ashbee award but failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman the times of trenton has reported that preeminent specialist from oklahoma has looked over tommy soderstroms medical record and determined that nofurther tests are necessary in the near future same paper had blurb about bill dineen being asked about whether or not

is no need to invoke any divine orspiritual explanations it makes big difference to claim that all things can be understoodas natural processes and to claim that our observations do notrequire us to postulate any divine intervention or anything spiritual for that matter humans are not omnipotent and neither is science however science has one advantage theology doesnt it is self correcting with nature as its judge it is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing self consistent simple picture of our universe science is no longera bunch of separate branches it is one from particle physics topsychology and no aspect of our life or our universe is safefrom its stern and stony eye not even our consciousness there is no need for any recourse to divnity to describe or explain anything there is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics chemistry biology etc everything is random nothing is determnined actually determinism vs indeterminism is philosophical question and science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually or not think the question does not haveany meaning as far as individual human beings go if their apparentfree will is an illusion it does not appear to be so from bill can you say sure_ whether you have freewill or not this would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products there is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence its just happy accident maybe who are we to tell it seems intelligence is useful whenduring the history of earth has species_ been able to controlone third of the whole biosphere this can still be result of numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicatesand preserves even that machinery can be result of the sameprinciple only the systems that can start replicating willsurvive those which dont dont make it recommended reading for an atheist no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought about an event can have value from whose perspective value events and things subjectively frommy perspective nature does not have values because it does not havea perspective values arise from awareness if have it is easy to assume that other people also do and ifi think about what it would it be like in their position willeventually discover the golden rule morality is not necessarilya gift from heavens in fact it may be product of evolution perhaps we are aware of ourselves because sense of identityis helpful allows us to play the roles of others and make us respectothers who seem to have identity too bill have you ever read aristotle try his ethica nikomakhea sp for starters how then can an atheist judge value what is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the bible or the purposes imputed to god on what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned it seems that in judging the values that motivate others to action you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured but what in nature can serve that purpose what law of nature can you invoke to establish your values lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason whyhe abandoned his atheism and became christian the argument isseverely flawed some values such as the golden rule can have rational basis someothers like the basic idea of wanting to live has probably itsroots in the way our brains are wired lewis ignored the very realpossiblity that natural selection could also favour and morality as well indeed as humans evolved betterand better in building and using tools they also became betterat killing each other it is logical necessity that evolution couldonly favour those who knew how to use tools but not against onesown people the bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early jewswas not beyond this simple set of rules to hold the peopletogether under one god their god did not care much about peopleof other nations at the time of the nt things were quite different the jewswere under rule of an and could no longer simply ignorethe gentiles new situation required new morality and alongwith it new religion was born mutation in meme pool since every event is entirely and exclusively physical event what difference could it possibly make what anyone does religious or otherwise there can be no meaning or gradation of value the only way an atheist can object to any behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he she just doesnt like it thats it any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any absolute sense it looks like you havent bothered to read philosophy whenever thereis an observer there is subjective point of view which may value its existence and happiness even if that were just resultof some physical event and others happiness too if the observercomes to think about it in an absolutely objective sense that is without any observers or subjects moral judgments lose theirmeaning it is not possible for value to simply exist without point ofview this includes gods too their values are only personal judgments not absolute truths since such truthsdo not exist the fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt othersis manifestation of the way we have fought for our existenceby becoming social beings who can think and value othersexistence morality is not property of humans alone chimps dolphins andmany other species show great care for each other dolphins havesometimes saved humans from drowning good deed indeed that you dont like what god told people to do says nothing about god or gods commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with pre existing thought set to form that reaction that your objections seem well founded is due to the way youve been conditioned there is no truth content the whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion virtual reality the last statement does not logically follow in fact there isevery reason to believe our thoughts can model reality verywell and our senses can convey reliable information solipsismis still logical possibility but not very likely one you are continuously mixing two different views the subjectivepoint of view which we all share and an objective point of view does not exist_ any observer or thinker any personal being has its own point of view it does not matter whether this pointof view is result of some physical events or not it does notcease to be subjective from non observers non point of view values do not exist neitherdoes pain or pleasure or beauty or love such things are inherently subjective once again if god wants wives to submit to their husbands or evento make leap of faith into the unknown or wants to punish us ifwe dont disagree with his morals do not think my morals comefrom any supreme being to remove my morals means the same thanto make me zombie machine without single thought if godgave us morality to judge but disagree with him it is not myfault he is free to replace my morals cannot see what is thepoint of giving someone moral system which disagrees with onesown and then to get mad at this god must be schizophrenic all of this being so you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values right wrong goood evil etc and cannot participate your opinion about the bible can have no weight whatsoever neither can the opinion of any god for that matter cannot understandwhy subjective opinion of thing made of matter is in any wayless credible than an opinion of thing made of something else bill take note absolute values must be independent of being gods if god has subjective viewpoint it is hisown point of view and his morals are his own petri petri pihko kem pmp mathematics is the truth pihatie

how law enforcement decrypts communications since there has been some speculation on this news group about myown involvement in this project id like to add that was not inany way involved found out about it when the fbi briefed me onthursday evening april since then have spent talking with the nsa and fbi to learn more about this and iattended the nist briefing at the department of commerce on april the document below is the result of that effort dorothy denning the clipper chip technical summary dorothy denning april introductionon april the president announced new initiative that will bringtogether the federal government and industry in voluntary programto provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs oflaw enforcement at the heart of the plan is new tamper proof encryptionchip called the clipper chip together with split key approach toescrowing keys two escrow agencies are used and the key parts fromboth are needed to reconstruct key chip structurethe clipper chip contains classified bit block called skipjack the algorithm uses bit keys comparedwith for the des and has rounds of scrambling compared with for the des it supports all des modes of operation throughput is mbits second each chip includes the following components the skipjack encryption algorithm an bit family key that is common to all chips bit serial number an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chipencrypting with the chipto see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the at ttelephone security device as it will be suppose call someone andwe both have such device after pushing button to start my security device will negotiate session key withthe device at the other end in general any method of key exchange canbe used the key and message stream digitized voice are thenfed into the clipper chip to produce two values the encrypted message stream and law enforcement block the law enforcement block thus contains the session key encryptedunder the unit key concatenated with the serial number allencrypted under the family key chip programming and escrowall clipper chips are programmed inside scif secure facility which is essentially vault the scif containsa laptop computer and equipment to program the chips about chipsare programmed during single session the scif is located atmikotronx at the beginning of session trusted agent from each of the two keyescrow agencies enters the vault agent enters an bit value into the laptop and agent enters an bit value these valuesserve as seeds to generate keys for sequence of serial numbers to generate the unit key for serial number the bit value isfirst padded with fixed bit block to produce bit block and are then used as keys to triple encrypt producing bit block similarly is padded with two other bit blocks to produce andn and two additional bit blocks and are computed and are then concatenated together giving bits thefirst bits are assigned to and the second bits to therest are discarded the unit key is the xor of and and are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrowagencies as sequence of values for and are generated they arewritten onto three separate floppy disks the first disk contains afile for each serial number that contains the corresponding key partu the second disk is similar but contains the values the thirddisk contains the unit keys agent takes the first disk and agent takes the second disk the third disk is used to program the chips after the chips are programmed all information is discarded from thevault and the agents leave the laptop may be destroyed for that no information is left behind the protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in theroom instead of two the first two would provide the seeds and and the second two the escrow agents would take the disks back tothe escrow agencies the escrow agencies have as yet to be determined but they will notbe the nsa cia fbi or any other law enforcement agency one orboth may be independent from the government law enforcement usewhen law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line theywill first take the warrant to the service provider in order to getaccess to the communications line let us assume that the tap is inplace and that they have determined that the line is encrypted withclipper they will first decrypt the law enforcement block with thefamily key this gives them they will then take awarrant identifying the chip serial number to each of the key escrowagents and get back and and are xored together to producethe unit key and is decrypted to get the session key finally the message stream is decrypted all this will be special black box decoder operated by the fbi acknowledgment and distribution notice all information is

cryptosystem what is an attack whats the advantage of formulating all this mathematically why is the one time pad secure whats ciphertext only attack whats known plaintext attack whats chosen plaintext attack in mathematical terms what can you say about brute force attacks whats key guessing attack whats entropy in mathematical terms what is private key cryptosystem private key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system and decryption system the encryption system is collection of functions e_k indexed by keys mapping some set of plaintexts to some set of ciphertexts similarly the decryption system is collection of functions d_k such that d_k e_k for every plaintext that is succesful decryption of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key index as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext into ciphertext such systems wherein the same key value is used to encrypt and decrypt are also known as symmetric cryptoystems what is an attack in intuitive terms passive attack on cryptosystem is any method of starting with some information about plaintexts and their corresponding ciphertexts under some unknown key and figuring out more information about the plaintexts its possible to state mathematically what this means here we go fix functions and of variables fix an encryption system and fix distribution of plaintexts and keys an attack on using assuming giving with probability is an algorithm with pair of inputs and one output such that there is probability of computing p_ p_n if we have p_ p_n and e_k p_ e_k p_n note that this probability depends on the distribution of the vector p_ p_n the attack is trivial or pointless if there is probability at least of computing p_ p_n if p_ p_n and c_ c_n here c_ c_n range uniformly over the possible ciphertexts and have no particular relation to p_ p_n in other words an attack is trivial if it doesnt actually use the encryptions e_k p_ e_k p_n an attack is called one ciphertext if two ciphertext if and so on whats the advantage of formulating all this mathematically in basic cryptology you can never prove that cryptosystem is secure read part we keep saying strong cryptosystem must have this property but having this property is no guarantee that cryptosystem is strong in contrast the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely formulate and if possible prove the statement that cryptosystem is strong we say for example that cryptosystem is secure against all passive attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system as defined above is too slow to be practical if we can prove this statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist any passive cryptanalytic technique if we can reduce this statement to some well known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that the cryptosystem isnt easy to break other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical definition again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions were making and prove that they produce the desired results we can figure out what it means for particular cryptosystem to be used properly it just means that the assumptions are valid the same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too the cryptanalyst can take advantage of incorrect assumptions often he can try to construct proof of security for system see where the proof fails and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis why is the one time pad secure by definition the one time pad is cryptosystem where the plaintexts ciphertexts and keys are all strings say byte strings of some length and e_k is just the sum lets say the exclusive or of and it is easy to prove mathematically that there are nontrivial single ciphertext attacks on the one time pad assuming uniform distribution of keys note that we dont have to assume uniform distribution of plaintexts heres the proof let be an attack an algorithm taking two inputs and producing one output with some probability that whenever and e_k then because the distribution of is uniform and independent of the distribution of must also be uniform and independent of but also the distribution of is uniform and independent of hence there is probability exactly that whenever and over all and thus fortiori is trivial on the other hand the one time pad is secure if key is used for more than one plaintext there are nontrivial multiple ciphertext attacks so to be properly used key must be thrown away after one encryption the key is also called pad this explains the name one time pad whats ciphertext only attack in the notation above ciphertext only attack is one where is constant given only some information e_k p_ e_k p_n about ciphertexts the attack has to have some chance of producing some information p_ p_n about the plaintexts the attack is trivial if it has just as good chance of producing p_ p_n when given c_ c_n for random c_ c_n for example say and say is the first bit of we can easily write down an attack the guessing attack which simply guesses that is this attack is trivial because it doesnt use the ciphertext it has fifty fifty chance of guessing correctly no matter what on the other hand there is an attack on rsa which produces one bit of information about with success using if it is fed random then the success rate drops to so this is nontrivial attack whats known plaintext attack the classic known plaintext attack has p_ p_ p_ c_ c_ c_ c_ and p_ p_ depending only on p_ in other words given two ciphertexts c_ and c_ and one decryption p_ the known plaintext attack should produce information about the other decryption p_ note that known plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature as producing information about the key but this is pointless the cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him decrypt further messages whats chosen plaintext attack chosen plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical series of attacks on cryptosystem attacks where the cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor these attacks dont fit into our model of passive attacks explained above anyway chosen plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose plaintext and look at the corresponding ciphertext then repeat until he has figured out how to decrypt any message more absurd examples of this sort of attack are the chosen key attack and chosen system attack much more important form of active attack is message corruption attack where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such way as to make useful change in the plaintext there are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks for instance automatically encrypting any plaintext as e_k where is time key sequence number chosen anew for each message is random number and is one way hash function here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive or in mathematical terms what can you say about brute force attacks consider the following known plaintext attack we are given some plaintexts p_ p_ and ciphertexts c_ c_ were also given ciphertext c_n we run through every key when we find such that e_k p_i c_i for every we print d_k c_n if is big enough that only one key works this attack will succeed on valid inputs all the time while it will produce correct results only once in blue moon for random inputs thus this is nontrivial attack its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many possible keys whats key guessing attack whats entropy say somebody is using the one time pad but isnt choosing keys randomly and uniformly from all bit messages as he was supposed to for our security proof in fact say hes known to prefer keys which are english words then cryptanalyst can run through all english words as possible keys this attack will often succeed and its much faster than brute force search of the entire keyspace we can measure how bad key distribution is by calculating its entropy this number is the number of real bits of information of the key cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within guesses is defined as the sum of p_k log_ p_k where p_k is the probability of key

sci electronics ,lines nntp posting host auvax organization adelphi university garden city nythere has been quite bit of discussion about house wiring and here few points need to be clarified the equipment grounding conductor green green with yellow stripe bare orthe metal sheath or pipe of some wiring methods is used as safety ground tocarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel and to limit thevoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects itshould never except for few exceptions to be discussed later carry thenormal operating current of connected load some equipment has filters inthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltageson the grounding conductor and may require special wiring of the to provide reliable operation orange outlets are often used forthis with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box and inmany cases back to the service anyone installing such system should readboth the section on grounding in the national electric code and publications oninstalling quiet isolated ground systems the code requires the conductors green wires to run with the current carrying conductorsback to the panel box and if required back all the way to the serviceentrance where it is bonded to the service ground water pipe or rod manyof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely where they do not providea safe ground or quiet ground or either the grounded conductor of circuit often called the neutral which isreferred to in the code as the identified conductor and is supposed to bewhite or natural grey this conductor is supposed to be connected to ground inmost electrical systems at single point generally at the service entrancepanel this connection is through the main bonding jumper in many panels the main bonding jumper is actually bonding screw whichattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel the grounded conductor neutral is generally current carrying conductor inthe case of volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing thecircuit from the panel to the load device since the grounded conductor neutral is only connected to the bare or green at the service entrance if the load is any distancefrom the service and draws any significant current there will be small butmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load under normal operating conditions if you should incorrectly connect thegrounded neutral conductor to the grounding conductor at the load some ofthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor sincethere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor it will alsono longer be quite at ground potential at the load end if the load equipmenthas metal case which is connected to the grounding conductor through the ground plug the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential the difference under normal non short circuit conditions may be only fewtenths of volt but it could also be volt or two this normally does notpresent shock hazard however if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contactwith an independently grounded object such as water or gas pipe radiator metal air conditioning duct or such part of the neutral current will try toflow through this aalternate ground path if the contact is not solid youwill get significant arc low voltage but possibly moderate current arc under the wrong conditions this arcing could start fire it is possible insome cases that the sneak ground current could also flow through wire ofinadequate size causing it to overheat with the incorrect non single point grounding of the neutral if there is ashort circuit from hot to neutral the high short circuit current which mayflow will cause much higher voltage on the grounding conductor whichincreases the possibility for shock or fire also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground the voltage onthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment oftencausing malfunction have spent some hours tracking down such shorts intechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment the neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer aswell as at the service entrance of each dwelling this is done primarily forlightning protection so that induced lightning currents have short path backto ground and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to groundedobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fusesquickly the bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from thedwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer some of itflows through the grounding electrode water pipe etc this may causecorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks and it may also cause measurable ac magnetic fields due to the large loopbetween the hot conductors in the service and the neutral current in thewater pipe and ground there are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy dont flame me on this im just telling you where the field comes from notits health effect as far as im concerned the jury is still out on this note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel not at anysub distribution panels this is one reason why it is illegal to run serviceentrance cable with the sheath used as neutral to sub panel you must havea seperate insulated conductor for the neutral the sheath can be used in thisapplication only as the grounding conductor if the neutral is bonded to thegrounding conductor in the sub panel say by forgetting to remove the bondingscrew all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be aboveground with the possible problems listed above the code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers as well as feeds from onebuilding to another in the cases of the range and dryer the neutral may beused as the equipment ground under certain conditions instead of seperatewire every time the code is revised these exceptions come up for review these exceptions were in fact the first required safety grounds in the daysbefore ground outlets and such the appliance manufacturers dont want tohave to redesign their ranges and driers and the contractors dont want tohave to run four wire cable with four fairly heavy expensive wires in placeof three wire to the appliances no question it would be safer with to the stove but the neutral current is low for most burner settings since most current is in the volt hots except at some low settings thewires are large gauge and there are few reported cases of injury or damage so far the exceptions have survived in the case of feeds between buildings its primarily for lightning protection people doing wiring should be aware what is and what isnt legal obviously the bare wire in romex with ground is anywherethere is green wire installed such as in portable cord that is goodgrounding conductor the sheath of bx clamped in bx connectors in metal boxesis legal grounding conductor in the us bx has an aluminum band run underthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath you can just cut thisaluminum band off at the ends you dont have to bond it to anything it doesits job by touching every turn of the bx sheath conduit or emt thinwalltubing is generally legal grounding conductor but may require bondinglocknut where it enters box or panel particularly for larger pipes greenfield looks like big bx but you pull your own wires in the emptysheath after you run it is not legal grounding conductor as it doesnt havethe aluminum band to bond it and the spiral steel has too much resistance andinductance you have to run seperate green grounding conductor inside thegreenfield wiremold is also not legal grounding conductor as the paint on the boxesoften prevents good contact and the feed to the wiremold extension is oftenfrom box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremoldbox have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold andthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were hot with volts why do get shock every time touch my computer and the radiatorhere in the office because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and oneof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box you must run aground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box inthe original wiring conduit bx etc where you can bond the wire to thebox with screw bnding clip or whatever on another issue while you should ground the green wire lug on gcfi outletswhen ever there is place to ground them it is legal in the nec to use themwithout ground if no ground is available it is better to have theprotection of the ground fault interrupter than no protection if you dontinstall it the interrupter doesnt depend on the

soc religion christian ,lines kwfinken pooh harpo uccs edu kevin finkenbinder wrote scott born phys virginia edu wrote intro deleted jesus wasnt really descended from david as the messiah was supposed to have been joseph was but christians say that joseph wasnt related to jesus truthfully if you look at the geneology of christ in luke and the one in matthew you will notice that they trace different lines back to david have been told that one traces marys line back to david and the other traces josephs line back to david both of them go beyond david in history acording to some of my jewish friends jewishness is passed to child by the mother and the legal rights of jewishness are passed through the father if it is true that one of these geneologies is marys then christs bloodline is from david through his mother this also means that christ had all of the legal rights of decendant of david as according to at least roman law and possibly mosaic law as well but am not sure joseph was christs legal father the argument for lukes genealogy being that of mary is very weak accordingto luke and when he began his ministry jesus himself was about thirty years of age being supposedly the son of joseph the son of eli aside from the fact that mary is not mentioned there are two either joseph was her father or he was her brother clearly this is not acceptable third would be that joseph the sonof eli was her father and just happened to have the name as the manto whom she was betrothed but that would seem to be grasping atstraws the most straightforward interpretation is that luke had nointention of tracing marys genealogy in which case he would havenamed her but that he traces her husbands from davids son nathan the matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from davidsson solomon to joseph matthew reads and to jacob was born joseph the husband of mary by whom was born jesus who is called christ there are two apparent problems the first is how to reconcile thetwo paternal genealogies which diverge with the sons of david solomon and nathan the second is why is any genealogy of josephrelavent at all if joseph had nothing to do with it if joseph wasnot jesuss physical father then the original poster is quitecorrect that claims for jesuss messianic heritage are not based ontruth but only on appearances whatever jesuss divine nature was the second problem is easy in my mind we assume that joseph was notinvolved in the conception of jesus in any way however holyspirit capable of working physical conception in mary is alsocapable of employing the physical agency of josephs seed in thiswork in our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its losssolely in terms of physical act whereas it is really matter ofpurity on much higher level as well the important thing is thatneither mary nor joseph was conscious of any union between them theyhad not known each other thus the first gospels dedication ofhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of joseph is quite relevantto jesus the virgin birth not withstanding to the first question there is an answer that creates to begin with moreproblems than it resolves it is that the two evangelists are relating the births of two entirely different children of two entirely differentsets of parents except for the names of the parents and the child and the birthplace in bethlehem there is no point in common between the two stories matthew and luke converge in their accounts only thirty yearslater with the baptism of jesus in jordan rudolf steiner offered hisexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then convergewith their accounts of the one jesus of nazareth he did not derive hisresolution from biblical study or speculation or from other and the discussion of how this could be might bring us beyondthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup in any case thedetails are described in steiners the spiritual guidance of the human being and of humanity the gospel of st luke and the gospel of st matthew whether or not rudolf steiners methods and explanation are acceptedas valid at least this interpretation resolves the of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact as for the passing of ones jewishness through the mother this wasnever an issue with jesus no one ever questioned his or marysjewishness the issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternalline of descent from david the king gerry palo compuserve com

sci crypt ,organization swiss federal institute of technology eth zurich chlines hmm followup on my own posting well who cares first let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about theclipper chip from what hellman and denning were able to tell us the chip itself is not confined to digital telephony but performsgeneral encryption in symmetric manner the chip supports cfb ofbecb and whatever the fourth mode of operation for des is the of rounds of whatever and takes bit keys input dataseems to be bit yes so if two people want secure communication whatever that means when clipper is involved they have first to agree on one secret key or is it one key per direction they can exchange this key via dh schemes or however somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the clipper chipwhich is now ready to work the clipper chip carries an unique serial number bits and key bits these key bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial numberwith seed bits the seed bits seem not to be stored in the chip at beginning of communication and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin before sending the fist real bit output of the first encryption the clipperchip puts out packets guess which represent the serial number and the session key this might look likex chipkeyk serial number where is transformation of these packets involving family key this family sp key is equal for all chips might be simple xor after that the digital phone call can be done as usual every packetbeing encrypted and decrypted by clipper denning describes how and shall be generated using seed of bits now leaving alone politics which does not concern me as much as you notbeing an american citicien tm there are some weak points in thisscheme which might be exploited by several parties as far as know about the generation of and look like the obvious backdoor they could be used to generate the chip keys by knowingthe serial number and also the family key of the chip really cantimagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise as true random sourcesfor the generation of the can be bought for not to much money then the escrows each of them will get bit of bit key securitycould as little as existant be maximized by giving them bitseach which have to be xored together to give the now lets simplyassume the escrows are trustworthy and cant be fooled by criminals orlaw enforchemnt agencies and there will be no quarrel between escrowsand which would hinder the in doing their duties and so onand so on once the keys are surrendered the is compromised forever not very clever imho how about sending in the encrypted session keys for each phone call thatthe police or whoever wants to listen to escrows could then simply decodethis session key and send it back to police and would naturally not do thisafter the warrant has expired this would be better technical solution but guess politics will not work that way apparently as miss dennings stated the only one performing actually decodesof intercepted messages shall be the fbi great so local guys can not inter cept understand your traffic anymore does this mean that the fbi monopolizesthe right to do legal wiretaps how is law over there have no idea whois allowed to tap and who not this certainly means that watched communi cations will be routed automatically from the service providing companyto the fbi if the communicaiton is watched one and this means as faras understand it that the family key has to be known by each switching company and those providing cellular phone servies etcetc so the family keywill not be very secret and thus serial numbers of calls will be readableby anybody who cares traffic analysis what do you guess what happens if you use the chip in ecb mode and thefirst few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled so the sessionkey would not be actually broadcasted over the line hmmm shouldnt be sodifficult to do that and now last point for the other side after all have read and heard aboutclipper not the programming language for dbase is it it seemsto have many advantages which shold not be overseen now an afterthought to your rights please note that have

of players were happy just to make the playoffs we won and thats all that matters said brett hull scoreless and minus for the night once we got up it was really tough to play some players didnt have problem just because the score was announced our line didnt quit said richsutter who played with bassen and miller we still had game to play youcant allow five goals like we did thats not right it was disappointing to see what was going on bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the blues effort somehow he missed the announcement of minnesotas loss didnt know it was final he said was kind of looking around on thebench didnt realize it was final for some reason were in the playoffs and thats great but its little disappointing to play like we did at theend the letdown was precisely the reason that berry had instructed the to keep the minnesota detroit score off of the board the scoreshowed until it first popped up with detroit leading in the thirdperiod the blues already led at the time told them didnt want to see the score didnt want to know the score berry said felt we had to win the game and thats the approach we took if minnesota took lead berry feared the pressure of having to win mightbother the blues if detroit led he worried the blues might quit until the announcement the blues played splendidly shanahan got the crowdgoing at of the first period scoring his th of the season then miller and bassen took charge late in the period with the teams playing four on four miller broke in on left wing dekeddefenseman roman hamrlik and beat former blues goalie pat jablonski with therebound of his own shot with seconds remaining in the period then just seconds later bassen rifled long slap shot past jablonskiafter defenseman rick zombo intercepted tampa pass in the neutral zone bassen made it just seconds into the second period scoring on the rebound of bret hedicans shot the goal gave him his first two goal game ofthe season and reminded him of special friend last year bassen befriended young oliver mulvihill who died of rare formof cancer at age on feb was thinking of my buddy oliver bassen said hes in heaven now andi know he was watching know hes happy miller increased the blues lead to on break away goal set up by zomboat then steve maltais broke curtis josephs shutout just secondslater making it less than minute after the north stars final was announced tim berglandscored and cut the lead to but shanahan scored his st converting passfrom nelson emerson with seconds remaining in the second period then it was all lightning adam creighton

rtfm mit edu as pub usenet news answers cryptography faq part xx the cryptography faq is posted to the newsgroups sci crypt sci answers and news answers every days contents what is the national security agency nsa what are the us export regulations what is tempest what are the beale ciphers and are they hoax what is the american cryptogram association and how do get in touch is rsa patented what about the voynich manuscript what is the national security agency nsa the nsa is the official security body of the government it was given its charter by president truman in the late and has continued research in cryptology till the present the nsa is known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the world governments in general have always been prime employers of cryptologists the nsa probably possesses cryptographic expertise many years ahead of the public state of the art and can undoubtedly break many of the systems used in practice but for reasons of national security almost all information about the nsa is classified bamfords book bamfd gives history of the people and operations of the nsa the following quote from massey mas highlights the difference between public and private research in cryptography if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted behind closed doors without doubt the number of workers engaged today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of those engaged in open research in cryptology for only about years has there in fact been widespread open research in cryptology there have been and will continue to be conflicts between these two research communities open research is common quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in scholarly journals but can government agency charged with of breaking the ciphers of other nations countenance the publication of cipher that it cannot break can researcher in good conscience publish such cipher that might undermine the effectiveness of his own governments code breakers one might argue that publication of provably secure cipher would force all governments to behave like stimsons gentlemen but one must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with political and ethical considerations of severity than in most scientific fields the wonder is not that some conflicts have occurred between government agencies and open researchers in cryptology but rather that these conflicts at least those of which we are aware have been so few and so mild what are the us export regulations in nutshell there are two government agencies which control export of encryption software one is the bureau of export administration bxa in the department of commerce authorized by the export administration regulations ear another is the office of defense trade controls dtc in the state department authorized by the international traffic in arms regulations itar as rule of thumb bxa which works with cocom has less stringent requirements but dtc which takes orders from nsa wants to see everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to bxa the newsgroup misc legal computing carries many interesting discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export what people think about those laws and many other complex issues which go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci crypt make sure to consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in jail if you are lucky your lawyer might know lawyer who has at least heard of the itar what is tempest tempest is standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer equipment it was created in response to the discovery that information can be read from computer radiation from crt at quite distance and with little effort needless to say encryption doesnt do much good if the cleartext is available this way what are the beale ciphers and are they hoax thanks to jim gillogly for this information and john king for corrections the story in pamphlet by ward goes thomas jefferson beale and party of adventurers accumulated huge mass of treasure and buried it in bedford county virginia leaving three ciphers with an innkeeper the ciphers describe the location contents and intended beneficiaries of the treasure ward gives decryption of the second cipher contents called it was encrypted as book cipher using the initial letters of the declaration of independence doi as key and are unsolved many documents have been tried as the key to aficionados can join group that attempts to solve by various means with an eye toward splitting the treasure the beale cypher association box beaver falls pa you can get the ciphers from the rec puzzles faql by including the line send index in message to netlib peregrine com and following the directions there are apparently several different versions of the cipher floating around the correct version is based on the pamphlet says john king kingj hpcc corp hp com some believe the story is hoax kruh kru gives long list of problems with the story gillogly gil decrypted with the doi and found some unexpected strings including hammer president of the beale cypher association agrees that this string couldnt appear by chance but feels there must be an explanation gwyn sci crypt expert is unimpressed with this string what is the american cryptogram association and how do get in touch

talk politics mideast ,nntp posting host ic ee umanitoba caorganization elect comp engineering of manitoba winnipeg manitoba canadalines would like to share with netters few points picked up from the pbs frontline program regarding irans nuclear activities aired on tuesday april for the sake of brevity ill present them in some separate points as many other western programs this program was laid on bed of misinformation throughout the program to maximize the effect of the program on the viewer some of the misinformations were as follows it was alleged that late imam khomeini objected to shahs technological advancements as anti islamic but now things have changed and the proof of change is that some iranian merchants are now selling personal computers these are the most ridiculous lies one can make about the objectives of the islamic revolution in toppling the shah and state of the technology in iran after revolution iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against iraqi aggressors while there has never been any proof in this regard and nobody has seen iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by iranian chemical weapons in contrary to what the whole world has seen about iranian soldiers and civilians injured by iraqi chemical weapons while the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against iraqi aggression has been officially announced to be about and even most radical counter revolutionary groups claim that iran and iraq had total of one million dead this program claims that iran alone has one million dead left from the war the translation of iranian officials talks are not true for example when iranian head of atomic energy says that it hurts me to see that iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda the translator says it hurts to see that iran is doing unfriendly research almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought by iranians were of countless dual usage while the program tries to undermine their non military uses without any reference to irans big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in near future and its current deficit in electrical power the whole program is trying to show the sharif university of technology as nuclear research center while even the cameramen of the program know well that in country like iran without so tightly closed society no one can make nuclear bomb in university taking in account the scientific advancement of sharif in engineering fields and its potential role in improvement of irans industries and eventually the lives of people it is obvious that they are persuading other countries to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones in scientific and industrial efforts key point in programs justifications is trying to disvalidate as much as possible all efforts done by iaea in their numerous visits from irans different sites they say we are not sure if the places visited by iaea are the real ones or not or we can not rely on iaeas reports and observation because they failed to see iraqs nuclear activities before as if they didnt know that iraq was trying to build nuclear weapons as an extremely personal opinion the most disgusting aspect of the program was the arrogance of the member of us senate foreign affairs william triplet in his way of talking as if he was the god talking from the absolute knowledge hope all iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their country in western media and hope iranian authorities continue to their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations mohammad international atomic energy agency

soc religion christian ,reply to johnsd rpi eduorganization not sun in article geneva rutgers edu gt prism gatech edu boundary writes dleonar andy bgsu edu pixie writes deletia sig if you do sincerely believe that god exists why do you follow it blindly do the words question authority mean anything to you defy any theist to reply deletia formalities probably should let this pass its not worth the time and its notreally intended for me but couldnt resist personal weakness of mine jerkius kneeus tragically incurable the foundation for faith in god is reason without which the existence of god could not be proven that his existence can be proven by reason is indisputable cf my short treatise traditional proofs for the existence of god and summa theologica not so can prove that the existance of god is disputableby showing that people dispute it this is easy dispute thatgod exists simple missed your traditional proofs treatise but the proofs rememberfrom the summa theologic the ways think it was were rather poorstuff the ontological argument is about billion times better imho would think youd want non traditional proofs considering the generalfailure of the traditional proofs at least the ones know of am thinking of the ontological argument the cosmological argument andthe teleological argument those are the ones traditional enough tohave funny names anyway now given that god exists and that his existence can be proven by reason assert that his commands must be followed blindly although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith why this is the real question so to discuss it ill assume god exists otherwise there is no heavenly authority to babble about because god is the first cause of all things the first mover of matter the independent thing that requires nothing else for its existence the measure of all that is perfect and the essential being who gives order to the universe logos please show this is the case am familiar with the first causeargument and ill accept for the sake of argument that thereis first cause even though find some of its the rest youll have to show this includesthat the first cause is god next assert that god is all good got it deny that god is all good so there if this is so then that which is contrary to the will of god is evil the absence of the good and since god can never contradict himself then by his promise of savior as early as the protoevangelium of genesis god instructs that because human adam was first responsible for mans alienation from the source of all good man would be required to act to restore the friendship thus god became incarnate in the person of the messiah this isnt self consistent if humans must renew the relationship then god incarnate or not cant do it well unless you think god ishuman granted god made himself human but this is nonetheless cheating the intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problemhe caused god fixing it even by indirect means contradicts this now this messiah claimed that he is the truth john if this claim is true then we are bound by reason to follow him who is truth incarnate why also why assume said claim is true anyway if claim to be truth are you bound by reason to follow me you next seem to have problem with authority have you tried the united states marine corps yet can tell you first hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority undoubtably do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of themarines without question you seem to imply this about god andthat the marines are similar in this respect if this is not whatyou are trying to say they please explain what it is you are saying as have missed it if you have not yet had the privilege will reply that the authority which is truth incarnate may never be questioned and thus must be followed blindly why why not question it even if it is truth we cannot know thiscertainly so why is it so irrational to question perhaps we willthus discover that we were wrong you assert that god is truth and we cant question truth buti assert that god is not truth and anyway we can question truth how is it my assertion is less good than yours one may not deny the truth oh hereby deny hope youll agree is the truth granted look pretty damn silly saying something like that but needed something wed both agree was clearly true now youll notice no stormtroopers have marched in to dragme off to the gulag no heaven lighting bolts either no mysteriousnet outages seem to be permited to say such things absurd or not for example when the proverbial apple fell on isaac newtons head he could have denied that it happened but he did not the laws of physics must be obeyed whether human likes them or not they are true they are certainly not true at least the ones newton derived arenot true and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or smalldistances we do not have set of laws of physics that alwaysworks in all cases if we did physics would be over already science is all about questioning this sort of truth if we didnt wed still follow aristotle id generalize this little more if you want to learn anything new you must question the thingsyou know tm because you can always be wrong therefore the authority which is truth may not be denied even presupposing that truth may not be denied and maynot be questioned and that god is truth it only followsthat god may not be denied or questioned not that he mustbe obeyed we could unquestioningly disobey him how annoying of us but you have not connected denial with disobedience dan no nickname johnsonand god said jeeze this is dull and it was dull genesis these opinions probably show what know

soc religion christian ,organization its like refusing gods kingdom come in one of jesus revelation in this century same thing as inthe old days people refuse to believe my messengers even wheni was alive here on earth they refuse me what more when am justtalking through somebody else paraphrased with all the knowledge believers accumulated he would think thatwe would be enlightened enough to detect which ones are authentic and divine as opposed to evil or man made these signs these miracles are you afraid that they are not from god that these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking they are evil well is faith in god evil is true peace evil is true love that is divine and pure evil why cant someone accept that god can do what he wants in fulfillment of his generous love and jesus never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to him for salvation why are we refusing gods messenger of this truth the mother to all who are in christ what brings us these fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us which in contrary could be pleasing to god fears of being humbled fears of being judged as wrong wrt mainstream standard of what is right why cant we tolerate non believers mockery or ridicule of us for the sake of peace love and obedience to god the humbling lessons left to us by martyrs and saints wed rather engage in never ending bickering and disproof of each others opinion looking at each others mistakes for the sake of arguments instead of having communion in one body with christ what makes us go blind to the truth that god is all powerful and that he can not be binded by what people wrote and have written about him in all ages why is our faith in god limited by all the words and literature we muster what prevents us from going beyond being saved and extend gods rich love to others who are not why are our eyes not wide open to see that he continuously sees our faith hope and love which glorify him and so he gives us indications of his with signs miracles ordinary common or divinely inspired everywhere isnt that like an atheist agnostics view that all these are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural why then does the holy mother comes back to remind us we must really that prayer__ changes the course of things and that with prayers wars can be prevented__ but then she continues you often have an egotistic attitude dear children in these days you have prayed very much your hands have remained empty__ why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done prayer conversion peace penance fasting the holy mass living life as what the gospel brings why not do so how to the world to this the mother says start in your family be good example live the word why worry if it is going to be of good use to many our holy mother says the fruits them to the lord__ do not worry about anything or anyone but entrust yourself to the lord although the holy mother does not insist because you are free bow before the freedom which god gives you but she follows this with you are surprised because say to you decide for god and yet see how you have lived this day why does she constantly conveys take this life toward god in the way as to the lord himself in your and only__ when you pray or one time when we decide that we are saved or talk write about god etc the holy mother warns satan the serpent is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from my peace plan and prayer rev the dragon became angry with the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings those who keep gods commandments and bear witness to jesus do you have fear or hate for gods current messenger of true peace love and our motherly protector from the anti christ the one who is being apprehensive of communism wars famine and other evils that the serpent brings upon us this obedient and blessed new eve the mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against satan havent there been renewed faith hope love peace and obedience wherever this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that god has given her in good purpose why do we choose to be blind why fear the truth that god has been giving us chance and sharing christs ever forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother the mother who has been consecrated the task reverse__ the disobedient harm and example done by the ancient eve she has been preparing the new eden with her immaculate heart the new eden as sanctuary the womb for the next coming and judgement of the righteous by our lord jesus christ when the lamb marries his bride shouldnt we give her hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the second coming of her son as she has been conceived without sin to bear the son of god in her womb why fear true peace love and renewed faith and obedience to god that mary faithfully brings to gods children she has been protecting the flock the rest of the offsprings from the greedy dragon so as to present more righteous members for her sons coming not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy of belief with prayer and guidance from the holy spirit and of course approval of our church authorities we should be aware of the true and divinely inspired ones specifically the ones which aligns with the scripture also our lady reminds us of recommendation of in our prayers if you speak unceasingly in your prayers how will you be able to hear god allow him room to answer you to speak to you she encourages us with motherly nurturing to continue in exuberant faith hope and love to jesus constantly not with mere emotions but with deep constant obedience to jesus her beloved son of our need to have him as part of our lives lets not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the lifethat god wants us to live when there wont be enough time or whenit will be late nowadays mary says pray pray pray for peace reconciliation my children have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace toothers for without peace you can not fully accept my son and you think shes just an ordinary lady not to me shesour good mother messenger from god and she is so nice enough toshare gods kingdom to us through her son and experience it with mary we are assured that the lamb always succeeds note all enclosed in quotes are from latest news of medjugorje number june by fr rene laurentin new mother of eden most purepreparing the sanctuary for true us with peace for gods kingdom comebring us to your loving protective and obedient churchthat we may belong in one body to your son jesus christ our lordand not go astray from his perfect that we ourselves pray with the holy spirit guiding usso that we may help you in

soc religion christian ,organization bell northern research ottawa canadalines have come across what consider to be an excellent tract it is abit lengthy for posting but thought id share it with all of youanyway feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel mightbenefit from what it says may god richly bless those who read it what kind of question is that anyone who can read sees signs tracts books and bumper stickers that say god loves you isnt that true it is true that god offers his love to the whole world as we read in one of the most quoted verses in the bible for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life john however gods love is qualified the bible says the way of the wicked is an abomination unto the lord but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness proverbs for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish psalm but am not wicked am decent moral person surely the good have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad have done how can these verses apply to me by gods standard of righteousness even the most moral person is looked upon by god as desperate sinner on his way to hell the bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to heaven on the contrary we are all sinners and we are all guilty before god as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after god romans the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it jeremiah if am such wicked person in gods sight what will god do to me the bible teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will come under eternal punishment in place called hell for fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on fire the foundations of the mountains will heap mischiefs upon them will spend mine arrows upon them they shall be burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction will also send the teeth of beasts upon them with the poison of serpents of the dust deuteronomy oh come on now hell is not real is it surely things are not that bad indeed hell is very real and things are that bad for the individ ual who does not know the lord jesus christ as savior the bible makes many references to hell indicating that it is both eternal and consists of perpetual suffering and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire revelation so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth matthew when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power thessalonians that is terrible why would god create hell hell is terrible and it exists because god created man to be accountable to god for his actions gods perfect justice demands payment for sin for the wages of sin is death romans for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad corinthians but say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment matthew does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought to life again to be judged and then to be sent to hell indeed it does that is unless we can find someone to be our substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal damnation for our sins that someone is god himself who came to earth as jesus christ to bear the wrath of god for all who believe in him all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all isaiah but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed isaiah for delivered unto you first of all that which also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures corinthians for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him corinthians are you saying that if trust in christ as my substitute who was already punished for my sins then will not have to worry about hell anymore yes this is so if have believed in christ as my savior then it is as if have already stood before the judgment throne of god christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him john but what does it mean to believe on him if agree with all that the bible says about christ as savior then am saved from going to hell believing on christ means whole lot more than agreeing in our minds with the truths of the bible it means that we hang our whole lives on him it means that we entrust every part of our lives to the truths of the bible it means that we turn away from our sins and serve christ as our lord no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon matthew repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord acts are you saying that there is no other way to escape hell except through jesus what about all the other religions will their followers also go to hell yes indeed they cannot escape the fact that god holds us account able for our sins god demands that we pay for our sins other religions cannot provide substitute to bear the sins of their followers christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and save us neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved acts jesus said am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me john if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness john now am desperate do not want to go to hell what can do you must remember that god is the only one who can help you you must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of god as you see your hopeless condition as sinner cry out to god to save you and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me sinner luke sirs what must do to be saved and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved acts but how can believe on christ if know so little about him wonderfully god not only saves us through the lord jesus but he also gives us the faith to believe on him you can pray to god that he will give you faith in jesus christ as your savior for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god ephesians god works particularly through the bible to give us that faith so if you really mean business with god about your salvation you should use every opportunity to hear and study the bible which is the only word of god in this brochure all verses from the bible are within indented paragraphs give heed to them with all your heart so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god romans but does this mean that have to surrender everything to god yes god wants us to come to him in total humility acknowledging our sinfulness and our helplessness trusting totally in him the sacrifices of god are broken spirit broken and contrite heart god thou wilt not despise psalm because we are sinners we love our sins therefore we must begin to pray to god for an intense hatred of our sins and if we sincerely desire salvation we will also begin to turn from our sins as god strengthens us we know that our sins are sending us to hell unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities acts doesnt the bible teach that must attend church regularly and be baptized will these save me if possible we should do these things but they will not save us no work of any kind can secure our salvation salvation is gods sovereign gift of grace given according to his mercy and good pleas ure salvation is not of works lest any man should boast ephesians what else will happen at the end of the world those who have trusted in jesus as their savior will be transformed into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with christ forever more for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord thessalonians what will happen to the earth at that time god will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens and new earth where christ will reign with his believers forever more but the day of the lord will come as thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness peter does the bible give us any idea of when the end of the earth will come yes the end will come when christ has saved all whom he plans to save and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for witness unto all nations and then shall the end come matthew can we know how close to the end of the world we might be yes god gives much information in the bible concerning the timing of the history of the world and tells us that while the day of the lord will come as thief in the night for the unsaved it will not come as thief for the believers there is much evidence in the bible that the end of the world and the return of christ may be very very close all the time clues in the bible point to this for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon woman with child and they shall not escape thessalonians surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets amos but that means judgment day is almost here yes it does god warned ancient nineveh that he was going to destroy that great city and he gave them forty days warning and jonah began to enter into the city days journey and he cried and said yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown jonah what did the people of nineveh do from the king on down they humbled themselves before god repented of their sins and cried to god for mercy but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto god yea let them turn every one from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish not jonah did god hear their prayers yes god saved great many people of nineveh can still cry to god for mercy so that will not come into judg ment yes there is still time to become saved even though that time has become very short how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him hebrews in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is refuge for us psalm

actual ly says find it to be the most credible research with respect to whatthe future holds that have ever come across and agree with him thatthere is just too much data to ignore while none of us is guaranteedone more second of life and while we therefore should take thesematters very seriously regardless of when christ will actually return it would appear that our natural tendency to postpone

utcc utk edu pa utkvm utk edu david veal writes come to that under the original plan there wasnt meant to be anything much for the federal government to do except keep the british out thats also untrue but at least were wandering little closer toward reality that the articles of confederation fell apart is enough proof it was there for just tad bit more well yes and no the federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore difficult to determine precisely what maddison etc were up to from them there are couple of ways to look at them one is we wantyou to support this constitution so well say anything that we thinkwill appeal to you or the more straightforward this is why we thinkwhat weve suggested in this constitution is good idea you clearly consider the former to be the primary situation they certainly emphasised limited role for the federal government but this was not necessarily their true position well know hamilton was dyed in the wool monarchist and probably the authoritarian extreme to jeffersons democratic impules but what would you suggest as means of determining their opinionson the government if we dont consider what they wrote about thegovernment and is writing in support of something automatically propoganda to the point we must assume it is untrue or that they are saying whatthey dont believe and like the house of lords which it is copied from it was given pretty wide powers unfortunately they started to use them and thus the gridlock set in wasnt aware the house of lords had wide powers was under the impression is was pretty powerless compared to the house of commons and certainly didnt have almost equal their powers the senate is restricted only that it may not introduce bills relating to raising revenue the senate was less powerful than the house of lords in the period in question if the senate was less powerful than the house of lords thanwed almost have to state that the house of representatives was also in fact they both were because the british government had muchgreater power than did the american system my reading of the constitution and other writings gives me absolutely no reason to believe the senate wasnt intended to make use of their law making powers in fact grid lock appears to have been designed into the system with the senate being more deliberative body to act as check on the more often elected house the system is meant to be slow to react the problem is that it ended up bit too slow disagree the system is not too slow it was simply designed tohandle less than it has demanded that it handle as somebody in washingtonput it whose name forget congress has become everybodys citycouncil congress is more than capable of quick action and has more thanenough power and time on its hands if it confined itself to what itsoriginal jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy it is not case of the system of government they created failing but that it is operating under set of conditions they to avoid namely concentration of power it would seemthen that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of eitherhouse in some attempt to grease the wheels all youll get then isa system which moves quicker to do stupid things it would make moresense to make more decisions at local level on what basis do you suggest that the senate was supposed to be some sort of rubber stamp for the house youll note that while the presidents veto may be over ridden the house cant do anything about veto by the senate the president veto was meant to be entirely separate until bush abused it in quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent of being check on unreasonable legislation please explain to me how bush abused the veto in an extraordinary manner the veto was clearly regarded as completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive fail to see where any restrictions implied or otherwise wereplaced on the veto it could just as easily have been read as meansto put check on democratically popular but unwise in the policies there is no limit in the constitution to the presidents veto powerregarding what bill is for previous presidents have used the vetofor any number of reasons most usually having something to do with theiragenda am really curious how you single bush out as the presidentwho abused vetos the senate is not meant to be exactly rubber stamp body it is meant as check on unrestrained legislation that is the extra measure built into the constitution in favour of the status quo of the representatives of the states is not reasonable restriction why is it not reasonable restriction because senatorsis the magic holy number upon which laws must be based if senatorsfeel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and fillibuster isnt that enough to indicate theres sufficient questionas to whether law is good idea or not to re evaluate it why one earth should be sufficient to enact law whichcovers million people in very very diverse places and livingin radically different conditions why shouldnt super majoritybe

with industry in to improve the security and privacy of while meeting the legitimate needs of lawenforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new products toaccelerate the development and use of advanced and networks and wireless communications links for too long there has been little or no dialogue between ourprivate sector and the law enforcement community to resolve thetension between economic vitality and the real challenges ofprotecting americans rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy andlaw enforcement previous policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer it is now being used toprotect electronic mail and computer files while can help americans protect business secrets and theunauthorized release of personal information it also can be usedby terrorists drug dealers and other criminals state of the art microcircuit called the clipper chip hasbeen developed by government engineers the chip represents anew approach to encryption technology it can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached toan ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many incommercial use today this new technology will help companies protect protect the privacy of personal phone prevent unauthorized release of data at the same time this technology preserves theability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals key escrow system will be established to ensure that the clipper chip is used to protect the privacy of law each device containing the chip will have two unique keys numbers that will be needed by authorized to decode messages encoded by the device when thedevice is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separatelyin two key escrow data bases that will be established by theattorney general access to these keys will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awiretap the clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the of americans to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology theattorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices in addition respected experts from outside thegovernment will be offered access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly reporttheir findings the chip is an important step in addressing the problem ofencryptions dual edge sword encryption helps to protect theprivacy of individuals and industry but it also can shieldcriminals and terrorists we need the clipper chip and otherapproaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with accessto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using itto hide their illegal activities in order to assess and explore new approaches like the key escrow system the president has directed government agencies to develop acomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and the need of companies to manufacture and export high technology products the president has directed early and frequent consultations withaffected industries the congress and groups that advocate theprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed the administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of national which will use new and to give americans unprecedented access toinformation this infrastructure of high speed networks information

that infrastructure the federal government must actquickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regardingits use the administration is committed to policies thatprotect all americans right to privacy while also protectingthem from those who break the law further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet the provisions of the presidents directive to acquire the newencryption technology are also available for additional details call mat heyman national institute ofstandards and technology questions and answers about the clinton initiativeq does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations no clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans suppose law enforcement agency is conducting wiretap on drug smuggling ring and intercepts conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message they would have to obtain legal authorization normally court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system who will run the key escrow data banks the two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks how strong is the security in the device how can be sure how strong the security is this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities whose decision was it to propose this product the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved in this decision this approach has been endorsed by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials who was consulted the congress industry we have on going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them who provides the clipper chip mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future how do buy one of these encryption devices we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the clipper chip into their devices if the administration were unable to find technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices this is fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration is developing the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the saying that every american as matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product there is false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administrations policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the same is true for other encryption devices one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on case by case basis for companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad we plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products jim gillogly trewesday astron

exploration of the saturnian system with its cassini saturn orbiter and huygens titan probe cassini is scheduled for launch aboard titan iv centaur in october of after gravity assists of venus earth and jupiter in vvejga trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at saturn in june of upon arrival the cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an orbit around saturn near the end of this initial orbit the huygens probe separates from the orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of titan the orbiter relays the probe data to earth for about hours while the probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the surface after the completion of the probe mission the orbiter continues touring the saturnian system for three and half years titan synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about flybys of titan and targeted flybys of iapetus dione and enceladus the objectives of the mission are threefold conduct detailed studies of saturns atmosphere rings and magnetosphere conduct close up studies of saturns satellites and characterize titans atmosphere and surface one of the most intriguing aspects of titan is the possibility that its surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere these hydrocarbons condense to form global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through titans clouds and determine if there is liquid on the surface experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere the cassini mission is named for jean dominique cassini the first director of the paris observatory who discovered several of saturns satellites and the major division in its rings the titan atmospheric entry probe is named for the dutch physicist christiaan huygens who discovered titan and first described the true nature of saturns rings key

usalines in article apr freenet carleton ca ac freenet carleton ca nikolaus maack writes come on gun kills people rather people kill people with guns the sad truth is sometimes that isgood or at least better than the alternative but lets ignore guns for defence and or crime and look at gun accidents ok there are about fatal firearm accidents per year and thenumber has been in decline since early this century most of theseaccidents involve rifles or shot guns not handguns but seriously gun is designed to fire bullet this is not so you can shoot cardboard cut outs down at the range in fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that the idea that my ruger mark ii bull barrel semi auto caliberhandgun was designed to kill or hurt people even for self defense would im sure come as surprise to its designer it certainly isntwhy have it it certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it and might even kill them but it is simply wrong to say it was designed tokill people this is not designed to act as tool for home defence where you show someone that you have gun and they go gee perhaps should leave in fact that is what happens most of the time most self defensive usesof firearms dont involve firing any shots most criminals would prefernot to be shot and will go to some effort not to be including doing whatyou say when you point gun at them if you were called on to design tool that could be easily carried toimmediately stop someone attacking you what would it be handgun isabout the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does workthe best no you see the gun was designed to fire that little bullet into human body and hurt them not tough concept to swallow for most certainly no one argues that handguns of the type we are discussing arent deadly weapons however it simply isnt true to say that all ofthem were designed to kill people moreover what exactly is wrong withhaving deadly weapons there are times when it is perfectly legitimate touse deadly force in self defense consider it not just my right but my duty to defend myself and my family and that includes having andknowing how to use the tools to do that the strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and beararms is as last resort to protect themselves against tyranny ingovernment jefferson think what jefferson said is still true and the trouble with having such an item is often the little bullet goes off into the wrong fleshy target not very often compared to other use or else uncle frank gets pissed and blows away his wife this isnt that common either at least when compared to other uses it isvery rare that non violent person will suddenly get pissed and killsomeone gun or not in most cases the people who murder have longhistories of violence if you have good reason to believe that thesepeople wouldnt kill if they didnt have gun feel free to present it having thing specificly designed to kill means it is much easier to kill things right right but there are times when killing things is called for hope inever have to shoot person but ive had to kill number of animals fromrodents to cows and when do dont want them to suffer any more thanis necessary prefer they die instantly but failing that want themto drop so can quickly finish them with the next shot and failing that dont want them to go fast or far try to choose the best weapon andammunition have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal imafter but it doesnt always work as plan without belaboring the point people who are overly impressed

honestly the word of sin is restriction would kid you does one mans words encompass the majestic vision of thousandsof individuals quoting man is not the same as quoting theorder taken out of context words can be interpreted muchdifferently than had one applied them within the confines oftheir original expression think this is the case regarding hymenaeus beta frater superior of the order to which belong when he included that bitfrom merlinus he did us all service he showed us the extremesto which order members have been known to go in their fervor have little knowledge regarding reuss background but surelyhe was an unusual man and he was an important force in the order for many years yet as people change so do orders change and while we look backso carefully at the dirty laundry of remember that this isonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now extend beyond any one individual hope to show that therewas and is much room for difference of opinion within the orderitself perhaps by testing the limits myself let us examine this issue bit more closely in karl kellner wealthy austrian paper chemist as well as high grade mason founded the ordotempli orientis kellner had traveled widely in the east where hemet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices kellners efforts to develop the order were later assisted by franzhartmann heinrich klein and theodore reuss who had worked togetherprior to joining the the order was first proclaimed in in reusss masonic publication oriflamme on kellners death reuss succeeded him as outer head the jubilee edition ofthe oriflamme published in announced that the order taughtsecret of sexual magic theodore reuss was an interesting character born june inaugsburg he entered masonry in he was singer journalist andpossibly spy for the prussian political police infiltrating the socialistleague founded by karl marxs daughter and her husband reuss waslater associated with william wynn westcott leader of the goldendawn who later introduced him to john yarker yarker chartered reuss tofound the rites of memphis and mizraim in germany after severalattempts to concretize various masonic rites reuss settled on thedevelopment of the the order experienced reasonably steady growth under reuss leadership for example he chartered papus in france rudolph steiner in berlinand spencer lewis in the usa in the historic meeting betweenreuss and crowley occurred crowley wrote that reuss came to him andaccused him of revealing order secrets when crowley looked at it afresh the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him forthe first time reuss appointed crowley as supreme and holy king of allthe english speaking world and it was this authorization that he invokedwhen publishing the material of the equinox reuss resigned as outer head of the order in after suffering astroke and named crowley his successor all was well until when_the book of the law_ was translated into german there was breakin the continuity of the order manyk members split with the new over the book which crowley was actively promulgating through the order he had earlier revise dthe order rituals at reusss request deeplyinfusing the doctrines of the new aeon revelation introduction to the history of the by ad veritatem ixwithin iii edited by hymenaeus beta frater superior rex summus sanctissimus caliph of the united states of america published by samuel weiser there are many possible reasons that our frater superior included thismaterial in iii and this is the real point is it not why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his ownorganization does he represent dogmatic threat to the principleof thelema or is he exercising his true will and putting forth verycomplex pictures with no easy answers picture which leaves roomfor very many interpretations it is quite easy for me to see for example that all of derivedout of the dribble of faltering masonry purchased by clever hucksterswith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them and ican take that all the way down to our present caliph whose feeblesupport of the law of thelema is laughable at best would be thrown out of the order for speaking in this way will think not why because my frater will see it as perspective an interjectioni am using as an example my illustration shows that we may express thingsin the context of larger work and the true significance of this may bequite difficult to apprehend at first so it may be with oto and merlinus please look more carefully do not support reusss words myself as am not qualified to assessthem and am critical of their pomposity if who am member ofthe order take such stand and am allowed to continue doing so thenwhat can this say about the health of the order does it mean thatthe order has gone soft and abandoned its moral principles ordoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will ofuniversal kinship arise on its own not shackled by some how shall we resolve these two possibilities find high calibre of individual associated with ordo templi orientis they are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcaneor usual information they are quite often artists and geniuses having met some longstanding members in the sf bay area many who are orwere very heavily involved with the order can vouch for the integrityof the organization as it stands have sometimes questioned the policy of hymenaeus beta in these moments followed my intuition and ive found little to stop me from requestinga second initiation from different body im happily participatingin social groups feasts or initiations and have come to know the gnosticmass well enough for my tastes this doesnt make me an authority on order politics and explanations however can only hypothesize and relay to you what understand based on mylimited contact with other members urge you not to take the words of merlinus too far there are manyways to interpret words and many people who have become involved withthe order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedomand the preservation of individual vision welcome other

cx has been updated see entry format xx we will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ansi cx compiler certain old obfuscation hacks that cause ansi compilers fits are no longer permitted some of the new issues deal with non integral array types variable number of arguments preprocessor directives and the exit function see our likes and dislikes xxxhints and suggestions xx you are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests seex for more information for details on how to get previous winners xx keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entriesx may not be valid entries this year what was unique and novel one yearx might be old the next year xx an entry is usually examined in number of ways we typically applyx number of tests to an entry xx look at the original sourcex convert ansi tri graphs to asciix pre process the source ignoring include linesx pre process the source ignoring define and include linesx run it through beautifierx examine the algorithmx lint itx compile itx execute itxx you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has beenx cleaned up by the pre processor and beautifier xx your entry need not do well under all or in most tests in certainx cases test is not important entries that compete for thex strangest most creative source layout need not do as well asx others in terms of their algorithm on the other hand givenx two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry thatx does something interesting when you run it xx we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules as such we leavex the contest open for creative rule interpretation as in real lifex programming interpreting requirements document or customer requestx is important for this reason we often award worst abuse of thex rules to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way xx if you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us knowx in the remarks section please note that an invitation to abusex is not an invitation to break we are strict when it comes to thex byte size limit also abusing the entry format tends tox annoy more than amuse xx we do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entriesx to attempt to exploit them we will award worst abuse of the rulesx and then plug the hole next year even so we will attempt to usex the smallest plug needed if not smaller xx check out your program and be sure that it works we sometimes makex the effort to debug an entry that has slight problem particularlyx in or near the final round on the other hand we have seen somex of the best entries fall down because they didnt work xx we tend to look down on prime number printer that claims thatx is prime number if you do have bug you are better offx documenting it noting this entry sometimes prints the th powerx of prime by mistake would save the above entry and sometimes strange bug feature can even help the entry of course correctlyx working entry is best xxxour likes and dislikes xx doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become old wex tend to see thru masses of defines due to our pre processor testsx that we apply simply abusing defines or dfoo bar wont go as farx as program that is more well rounded in confusion xx many ansi compilers dislike the following code and so do we xx define definex foo dont expect this to turn into define fooxx int dont use such implicit type declarationx int xx we suggest that you compile your entry with an ansi compiler if you must use non ansi such as you must avoid areas that result in compile link errors for ansi compilers xx unfortunately ansi requires array indexes to be of integral type thus the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed xx int char use insteadx string use string insteadxx if your entry uses functions that have variable number ofx arguments be careful systems implement va_list as wide varietyx of ways because of this number of operations using va_list arex not portable and must not be used xx assigning non va_list variable to from va_list variablex casting non va_list variable into from va_list variablex passing va_list variable to function expecting non va_list argx passing non va_list variable to function expecting va_list argx performing arithmetic on va_list variablesx using va_list as structure or unionxx in particular do not treat va_list variables as if they were char xx avoid using varargs use stdarg instead xx if you use preprocessor directives define if ifdef the leading must be the first character on line while somex preprocessors allow whitespace the leading many do not xx because the exit function returns void on some systems entriesx must not assume that it returns an int xx small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise while such programs are not as complex as other winners they dox serve useful purpose they are often the only program that peoplex attempt to completely understand for this reason we look forx programs that are compact and are instructional xx one line programs should be short one line programs say around bytes long getting close to bytes is bit too long in our opinion xx we tend to dislike programs that xx are very hardware specificx are very os or un version specificx index strchr differences are ok but socket streams specificx code is likely not to be dump core or have compiler warningsx it is ok only if you warn us in the remark header item wont compile under both bsd or sys un xx abusing the build file to get around the size limitx obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri graphsx are longer than they need to bex are similar to previous winnersx are identical to previous losers xx unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering thex best one liner category we suggest that you format your programx in more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines xx the build file should not be used to try and get around the sizex limit it is one thing to make use of several ds to help out but it is quite another to use bytes of ds in order tox try and squeeze the source under the size limit you should feelx free to make use of the build file space but you are better offx if you show some amount of restraint xx we allowed whitespace and in certain cases or do not impactx your program size up to certain point because we want to getx away from source that is simply compact blob of characters xx given two versions of the same program one that is compact blobx of code and the other that is formatted more like typical cx program we tend to favor the second version of course thirdx version of the same program that is formatted in an interestingx and or obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two xx we suggest that you avoid trying for the smallest self replicatingx program we are amazed at the many different sizes that claimx to be the smallest there is nothing wrong with self replicatingx programs in fact number of winners have been self replicating you might want to avoid the claim of smallest lest we or others know of smaller one xx client entries should be as portable as possible entries thatx adapt to wide collection of environments will be favored dontx depend on particular type of display for example dont dependx on color or given size dont require backing store xx client entries should avoid using related libraries andx software that is not in wide spread use we ask that such clientx entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and thex athena widget set libx libxaw libxmu and libxt dont use tif xv ew or openl ok toolkits since not everyonex has them avoid depending on particular window manager notx everyone has and some people are stuck back in orx earlier so try to target without requiring betterx yet try to make your entry run on all version window systems xx client entries should not to depend on particular items onx xdefaults if you must do so be sure to note the required linesx in the remark section xx we like programs that xx are as concise and small as they need to bex do something at least quasi interestingx pass lint without complaint not requirement but it is nice are portablex are unique or novel in their obfuscation stylex make use of number of different types of obfuscationx make us laugh and or throw up xx some types of programs cant excel in some areas of course yourx program doesnt have to excel in all areas but doing well in severalx areas really does help xx we freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments inx the remark section helps your chance of winning if you had tox read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy good laugh or two we think the readers of the contest winners do as well xx be creative xxxentry format xx in order to help us process the many entries we must request yourx assistance by formatting your entries in certain way this format in addition allows us to quickly separate information about thex author from the program itself see judging process xx we have provided the program mkentry as an example of how tox format entries you should be aware of the following warning thatx is found in mkentry xx this program attempts to implement the ioccc rules everyx attempt has been made to make sure that this program producesx an entry that conforms to the contest rules in all cases where this program differs from the contest rules thex contest rules will be used be sure to check with thex contest rules before submitting an entry xx you are not required to use mkentry it is convenient however as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to checkx the entry against the size rules xx if you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints aboutx the mkentry program please send email to the judges see below xx the following is sample entry xx entry xrule xfix nxtitle chonglabxentry xdate mon

version of your build program files that uses the name convention you should uuencode these files in data sections xx if your entry needs to modify its source info or binary files please say so in the remark section you should try to avoidx touching your original build source and binary files you shouldx arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify thisx will allow people to re generate your entry from scratch xx remember that your entry may be built without build file wex typically incorporate the build lines into makefile if thex build file must exist say so in the remark section xx if your entry needs special info files you should uuencode themx into info sections in the case of multiple info files use multiple info sections if no info files are needed then skip the info section xx info files are intended to be input or detailed information thatx does not fit well into the remark section for example anx entry that implements compiler might want to provide some samplex

landon curt noll xx entries are unpacked into individual directories the email messagex is unpacked into individual files each containing xx entry sectionx all author sectionsx all info sectionsx build sectionx program sectionx any other text including the email message headersxx prior to judging the any other text file is scanned to be surex it does not contain useful information or in case the entry wasx malformed and did not unpack correctly information from thex author sections are not read until the judging process isx complete and then only from entries that have won an award xx the above process helps keep us biased for against any one particularx individual we are usually kept in the dark as much as you arex until the final awards are given we like the surprise of findingx out in the end who won and where they were from xx we attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award because the main prize of winning is being announced we make allx attempts to send non winners into oblivion we remove all non winningx files and shred all related paper by tradition we do not evenx reveal the number of entries that we received for the curious we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the iocccx winners at talks xx after the usenix announcement we attempt to send email to thex authors of the winning entries one reason we do this is to givex the authors chance to comment on the way we have presented theirx entry they are given the chance to correct mistakes typos wex often accept their suggestions comments about our remarks as well this is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world xx judging consists of number of elimination rounds during round the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that doesx not we also re examine the entries that were eliminated in thex previous round thus an entry gets at least two readings xx reading consists of number of actions xx reading the entry sectionx reading the uudecoded build sectionx reading the uudecoded program sectionx reading the uudecoded info section if anyx passing the source thru the pre processorx shipping over any include filesx performing number of beautify cleanup edits on the sourcex passing the beautified source thru the pre processorx shipping over any include filesxx in later rounds other actions are performed xx linting the sourcex compiling building the sourcex running the programx performing misc tests on the source and binaryxx until we reduce the stack of entries down to about entries entriesx are judged on an individual basis an entry is set aside because itx does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round when the number of entries thins to about entries we begin to formx award categories entries begin to compete with each other for awards an entry often will compete in several categories xx the actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entriesx we receive typical category list might be xx best small one line programx best small programx strangest most creative source layoutx most useful obfuscated programx best game that is obfuscatedx most creatively obfuscated programx most deceptive codex best client see our likes and dislikes best abuse of ansi cx worst abuse of the rulesx anything else so strange that it deserves an award xx we do not limit ourselves to this list for example few entries are sox good bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round we will invent awards categories for them if necessary xx in the final round process we perform the difficult tasks ofx reducing the remaining entries typically about down to or winners often we are confident that the entries that make it intox the final round are definitely better than the ones that do notx make it the selection of the winners out of the final round isx less clear cut xx sometimes final round entry good enough to win but is beat outx by similar but slightly better entry for this reason it isx sometimes worthwhile to re enter an improved version of an entry that failed to win in previous year this assumes of course that the entry is worth improving in the first place xx more often that not we select small entry usually one line ax strange creative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contestx rules in some way xx in the end we traditionally pick one entry as best sometimes suchx an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry more often thex best is picked because it does well in number of categories xxxannouncement of winners xx the first announcement occurs at summer usenix conference by tradition this is done during the latter part of the uunet ioccc bof just prior

writes the issue then is this christian says behavior such and such is sinful what is christian supposed to do with such statement one possibility always exists may be able to persuade that the behavior in question does exhibit failure in loving god or neighbor michael modern liberal that he is reads fairly benign meaning into this word he then constructs his religious beliefs around this understanding reading other scripture in the context of these commandments with love benignly understood regard love as no more or less benign than any other christian does you are merely expressing approval of the consequences find therein which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my or any religion love is highly ambiguous word of which christianscan write both the gentle words paul uses of it in corinthians ina passage that even the conservatives will quote at you and thewords of eliot in his pentacost hymn love is the unfamiliar namethat wove the intolerable shirt of flame this is in any case rather to the side of what was attempting to raisein my note as will become more evident below as non believer find michaels christianity kinder and gentler blechhh think you are misreading me rather seriously though given my principle that one cannot force ones own notion of sin onanother and my unshakeable russel turpinand others believers and unbelievers alike are under no threat of mylegislating my own understanding of christian love if take him at his word he cannot condemn the inquisitors because they were also following these commandments as they understood them ifyou misread can do and have repeatedly done complete bill ofaccusation against the inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough formas anyone might want demonstration of the harm it has done to humanbeings in the first place and to respect for let alone love of god in near succession please go back to my quoted words above the possibility that always exists is that or to revert to propertime sequence my predecessors over the last several centuries couldpersuade christian of my case that the inquisition does an egregious violation of the law of love must also notethat the majority of christians have been so persuaded by as well as by secular both christian and non christian prohibitions what mr turpin alludes to is trickier point demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved in the inquisition the inquisitor responds that mother church must however painful this seems discipline her children for their own good in this case the salvation of their souls or if the tortured heretic will not recant than by bad example deterring others from the same loss of soul point out that this justification of failure in love depends on highly speculative construal of texts and of philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable burns me at the stake my rhetoric has failed but the point am making is sustained what isgoing on here has lot to do with cultural baggage in this case the baggage includes nearly universal and absolutely secular beliefthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is mostbelievable if taken under torture the elimination of in those places where it has been eliminated or at leastgreatly reduced has very little if anything to do with the discussionof sin in the exchange between and mr turpin is pointing out that if am versus the grand inquisitors then my persuasion is not very likely to work know this and in what ever personal agony consign the issue to god and my ghostly defenseattorney so one possibility fails in this case as it will fail inmay others at the other extreme the persuasion will succeed when itproperly should not if it entails mistaken assumptions share with theinquisitor and that is potentially an even more troubling case in thatmany of the victims of inquisition will have accepted that they were infact sinful in such random cases as they may actually have been guiltyof charges brought against them the point is that the persuasion breaks down when the parties do notshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage and given the mainthrust of the inquisition against heresy it is bound to break downin precisely the worst cases the conservative dont think thatis the right word btw will take refuge in what attribute to above that he is justified in causing harm because he thinks that works toa greater good but this is violent and extravagant refusal to followthe gospel as if ones theories about sin entitled one to cast asidejesus words on dealing with sinners cf matthew ff am radical christian only in that take the gospel seriously or for that matter what does it mean to love ones fellow man and what is the right thing and how does one go about loving god well the whole point of making these the base commandments is thatthey arent reducible to rules set of rules is moral code or alaw code or an algorithm for acting such things can be very helpfulto individuals or societies but not if they are used instead of apersonal involvement in and responsibility for ones actions the is more than anything else call to act as if you weregod and accepting ultimate responsibility in your every action ademand that like most would rather not hear but it keeps poppingup nonetheless along with the reassurance that it is more importantthat be open to trying this than succeeding at it conservatives may twist this act as if you were god to mean lay down rules for otherpeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they dont keep your rules they are so insistent and obvious about this that they have convinced alot of people who rightly reject the whole concept that such idiocyis how god acts that after all is the standard accusation againstgod by the atheists here and elsewhere that the conservatives haveconfused their manipulative hoop jumping notions of coercing otherpeople with the nature of god is almost the entire content of atheism and quite agree with it on this point ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo up front much of which sounds pretty much the same but by the specific acts procedures and arguments that they recommend and different bodies of christians have from the beginning urged different ethical systems or in some cases none as result it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems however popular or infamous with christianity christianity does not have torah it does not have quran specifically christian scripture has verylittle if anything in the way of commandments so little thatthe christians who desperately want commandments go mining forthem with almost no support and thus almost no obvious limitation for their efforts the one single thing in the gospels which gives as commandment to us is love one another will be expanding on this point in reply to paul hudson that hope to get to in day or so it is quite true that some christians infer lots of commandments from the nt ill point out what has to be going on in these inferences and why there is huge amount of cultural baggage involved you are quite right that this is goo if one is looking for an ethicalsystem but why should anyone be looking for an ethical system since oursociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do itmay be that we need principle for the critique of ethical systems in which case will profer the allelou_ once again am glad that few christians such as michael find benign meaning for the goo and then interpret the usually ugly specifics in more constructive fashion on the other hand do think that this tells us more about michael and christians like him that it tells us about christianity think you are begging the question why dont and the myriadsof other christians like me tell you something about christianity nor is this very new in christianity you might want to look upthe origins and fundamental doctrines of the quakers from the thcentury onwards

see them at nuclear plants but not always at fossil fuel plants at nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle whereas fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot water as recall the water isnt as hot in many fossil fuel plants and of course there is less danger of radioactive contamination actually the reasons you dont see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are fossil units multiple units per plant are generally smaller thannuclear plants mwe seemed to be very popular size when manyfossil plants were built the average nuclear plant is mwe manyfossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations wereadopted why those old dirt burners cant harm anything let em go powered draft cooling towers low enough to the ground to be generallynot visible from off site are quite popular with fossil plants fossilplants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual boiling water reactor nuclear plants theres gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses vintage steam technology so its more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible hence big cooling towers oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water not most of the way down to ambient some plants do cool the condensers with water rather than air as one canadian official asked about thermal pollution de icing river said up here we view heat as resource actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plantsof similar size the issues are the same regardless of where the heat comes from condensers are run at as high vacuum as possible inorder to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine the condenser pressure isnormally waters vapor pressure at the condensing temperature it isdesirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocitycauses erosion of the condenser tubes the coldest and thus lowestpressure condensing environment is always the best related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell wherethe water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes since thecondenser is at very low pressure the only force driving the condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity if the condensate is too hot or the gravity head is too low the condensate will reflash intosteam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate this is aparticularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at allcosts the hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plantin order to provide gravity head to the pumps how much lower they must be is function of how hot the water is allowed to get inthe hotwell typically hotwell temperatures run between and degrees depending on the temperature of the river water this term isused to describe the river grade water even when the cooling towersystem is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river wateris pumped when the river water temperature is high in the summer operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order to provide more gravity head there is tradeoff involved since higherhotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce thecondenser area at least in the east and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in theair the river water will almost always be cooler than the dischargewater from the cooling towers the temperature of the discharge waterfrom the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature andhumidity it is very rare in the east to hear of actual river exceeding degrees vast difference from the typical days degrees humidity we see routinely in the east it is not unusual particularly where the econazis have been successfulin clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on plant for theplant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature getstoo high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without everybody runs closed cycle boilers the water used is purified of solids which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils purifying water for boiler use is bigger job than cooling it so the boiler water is recycled true actually secondary plant the part that makes electricity andfeeds feedwater to the boiler water chemistry has been the bastard stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves the plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understoodthe costs of impure water by impure mean water with fewdozen extra micromho of conductivity and or few ppm of

alt atheism ,lines mccullou whipple cs wisc edu writes my turn went back and reread your post all you did is attack atheism and say that agnosticism wasnt as funny as atheism nowhere does that imply that you are agnostic or weak atheist as most people who post such inflammatory remarks are theists it was reasonable assumption sorry youre right did not clearly state it rule condescending to the population at large theists will not win many people to your faith anytime soon it only ruins your credibility how am being condescending to the population at large am stating something that happened to be true for long time couldnt believe that people actually believed in this god idea it was an alien concept to me am not trying to win people to my faith as you put it have no faith religion was non issue when had the attitude above because it never even occurred to me to believe atheist by default guess you could say the most common form of condescending is the rational versus once one has accepted the that there is no god and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because theirassumption contradict your assumption then would say theres alack of consistency here now know youll get on me about faith if the belief that goddoes not exist were closed logical argument why do so many rationalpeople have problems with that logic but you probably like me seem to be soft atheist sorry for the flamage the line about atheists haveing something up their sleeves is what seemed to imply that sorry been reading too much on the clipper project lately and the paranoia over there may have seeped in some what is the clipper project btw rule dont mix apples with oranges how can you say that the extermination by the mongols was worse than stalin khan conquered people unsympathetic to his cause that was atrocious but stalin killed millions of his own people who loved and worshipped and his atheist state how can anyone be worse than that many rulers have done similar things in the past only stalin did it when there was plenty of documentation to afix the blame on him the evidence is that some of the early european rulers ruled with an iron fist much like stalins you threw in numbers and am sick of hearing about stalin as an example because the example doesnt apply you managed to get me angry with your post because it appeared to attack all forms of atheism it might have appeared to attack atheism in general but its point wasthat mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons people will hate whothey will and will wave whatever flag to justify it be it cross orhammer sickle the stalin example important not only because itsstill widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but alsobecause people really did love him and his ideas even after all that hehad wrought the evidence am referring to is more lack of evidence than negative evidence say claim there are no pink crows have never seen pink crow but that doesnt mean it couldnt exist but this person here claims that there are pink crows even though he admits he hasnt been able to capture one or get photo or find one with me etc in sense that is evidence to not believe in the existence of pink crows that is what am saying when look at the evidence look at the suppossed evidence for deity show how it is flawed and doesnt show what theists want it to show and go on first all the pink crows unicorns elves arguments in the world will notsway most people for they simply do not accept the analogy why one of the big reasons is that many many people want somethingbeyond this life you can pretend that they dont want this but forone can accept it and even want it myself sometimes and there is nothing unique in this example of why people want god can love as truth be proven logically themselves namely god or gods so in principle its hard to see how theists are necessarily arrogant makes no sense to me they seem arrogant to make such claim to me but my previous refutation still stands and believe there may be another one on the net john the baptist boasted of jesus to many people find it hard to seehow that behavior is arrogant at all many christians know also boastin this way but still do not necessarily see it as arrogance of course do know arrogant christians doctors and teachers as well technically you might consider the person who originally made given claim to be arrogant jesus for instance are you talking about all atheism or just strong atheism if you are talking about weak atheism which believe in then refuse such claim atheism is lack of belief used good ol occams razor to make the final rejection of deity in that as see things even if present the hypothesises in an equal fasion find the theist argument not plausible speak against strong atheism also often find that the faith is very subjective just as say the evidence supportinglove as truth is subjective believe answered that apologize for the as you stated incorrect assumption on your theism but saw nothing to indicate that you were an agnostic only that you were just another newbie christian on the net trying to get some cheap shots in no apology necessary bake timmons iii theres

talk politics misc ,nntp posting host pogo nsc comorganization thought police watchdog agency lines who wants to look through the bars at some reactionary liberal conspiracy theory idiots and see how they rant and rave at the erosion of their populist support this is very typical of the elitist liberal attitude that the people are incapable of thinking for themselves this elitist attitude will be theeventual undoing of the arrogant liberal tide sweeping america as the peoplebegin to realize more and more that they are being treated like errant childrenand robbed of their freedoms by bunch of utopian arrogent socialist jerks in article in talk politics misc new liberation news service nlns igc apc org writes lines from new liberation news service nlns written pm apr by nlns igc apc org in igc nlns news nlns packet fascism with friendly face does rush limbaugh remind you of anyone daevid bornhuetter machen the madison edge the main difference between adolf hitler and rush limbaugh is that hitler was original and showed initiative mort sahl on the tom snyder radio show abc radio network october although find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationaleof mr limbaugh find him entertaining and often agree with his conclusions the fact that he sends liberal reactionaries like theseidiots through the roof makes him all the more entertaining nlns believe it or not was planning this comparative review of mein kampf and limbaughs transcribed rant the way things ought to be before sahl issued his comparative review as usual sahls was independent and sharp as scalpel my effort can only dream of comparing favorably to morts at least it has fairly popular orginating premise everyone id mention the idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for delivery those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the most peripheral observer of the acts of those false prophets both are noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills which they both used with passion to generate political cult of massive numerical proportions in fact limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over million almost identical to the number of votes cast for hitler in the april german election both used myopic social perspective to build the cult and amputated facts from the record to fabricate their ideological quilt actually find limbaughs oratory less than sizzling and his debatingskills sometimes lacking even though his conclusions are often correct would suggest that bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated political power and loaded gun to force everyone to do the right things where right is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement is showing an acute case of myopic social perspective not to and utter stupidity limbaugh is certainly far from perfect but his opponents in the establishedbody politic and the media are the ones arguing for federal control ofvirtually all aspects of the lives of the citizenry and for the eliminationof local control over affairs public perhaps limbaugh has following because the people are tired of being treated like errant children by self important group of arrogant controlling myopic people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the oughta bes inside their own hopelessly closed minds the last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening pages of both books hitlers example is when on page he claims the german nationalist terrorist leo schlageter he bombed part of railway line between dusseldorf and duisburg being caught in the act in was betrayed to france by representative of his government when there has never been any factual foundation for such statement in fact the governments of both the reich and prussia as well as the vatican actively intervened to save him from execution and almost succeeded ok let us take your word for that and work with it nice limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic claim in his introduction that in school or during commencement ceremony or many other public places god is of course its not god but the official imposition of particular concepts of god against an individuals will thats but limbaugh is too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that hmmm congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof liberal translation thefederal government as long as it is run by liberals may force localschool districts to include certain iconic content in christmas displays while prohibiting others think limbaugh has you on this one it seems to me that he is arguingfor less imposition of the federal government into religion nice job on the specificity of that one too analysis of historical modern communication media deleted but as mort sahl also observed on the radio the other night some cloutmeister of the radical right wants limbaugh to be focal point of their propoganda and remember sahl is an al haig conservative these days mort might not know exactly who rushs equivalent of rodolf hess is the book itself suggests ed mclaughlin the former president of abc radio and now limbaughs partner in efm media the radio programs production company but mort himself is veteran of the talk show having hosted them in new york washington and los angeles he knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men he knows that limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the opportunity been placed on silver platter and handed to him limbaugh earns his money just as honestly as al capone did its almost worthy of rico indictment ah yes it is conspiracy of profound proportions methinks that youmay be bit resentful of mr limbaughs success because you attribute itprimarily to luck how after all could anyone with profound differencesof opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation ofconspiracy or blind luck do you feel this same level of knee jerkresentment against lottery winners or do you congratulate them on theirgood fortune on questions of social issues there is an overabundance of material in the limbaugh book that seems to echo hitlers venom for example this should be great fun since it is the liberal movement in americathat is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of the peopleand business government business partnership indeed and mr limbaugh is the populist nemesis of that movement have read mr limbaughs book and although it was not the most literarypiece have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain venom at all let alone venom comparable to an individual who callously out of racism on their own qualifications to control society hitler out of the host of sometimes millions of people who individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth partly perhaps understand it one man authors emphasis must step forward in order to form with apodeictic force out of the wavering world of imagination of the great masses granite principles and to take up the fight for their sole correctness until out of the playing waves of free world of thought brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises page very serious tone in that oratory limbaugh who needs the media when theyve got me the show is devoted exclusively to what think the phrase with half my brain tied behind my back to make it even denotes the egress of mental aptitude require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree with me it might take four or five years but im convinced the media will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking kicking and screaming all the way pages and respectively you neglect to mention that mr limbaugh have you ever listened to his show btw continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves ratherthan blindly following any media icon himself included you yourself mention that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions he also adopts rather satirical approach and presumes his audience to beintelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness and he says as much this is in contrast to the average mass media show in which the audience istreated as societys intellectual lowest common denominator am sure that adolf hitler was master of satire am sure he was justkidding when he said that the jews were the cause of germanys problems andneeded to be exterminated on religion as the basis of nation hitler in this world human culture and civilization are inseperably bound up with the existence of the aryan his dying off or his decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of time without culture he who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the lord sins against the benevolent creator of this miracle and helps in the expulsion from paradise page this is not religion it is clearly perverse worship of race sincechrist was jew it seems quite unlikely that hitlers ofthe aryan as the highest image of the lord fits with christian doctrine limbaugh america was founded as judeo christian country but our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or ambivalent toward religion people for whom belief in god is at best charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools for the last thirty years is it only coincidence that the quality of american education has declined ever since pages private religious schools have vastly better record of success thanpublicly funded schools american history is indeed primarily judeo christian suppose that mr limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalentto adolf hitler worshiping the aryan race think you might be reachingjust wee bit here on popular culture as reason for social collapse hitler the fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in one has only to look at the menus of our movie houses vaudevilles and theatres and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food theatre art literature movies the press billposters and window displays must be cleaned of the symptoms of rotting world and put into the service of moral idea of state and culture pages and definite suggestion that the government should control the here limbaugh today hollywood is in trouble the reason is that hollywood has forgotten who its audience is they make fun of people who believe in god they ridicule the traditional family heterosexuality and monagamy they disparage american heroes page just guess here but dont think that mr limbaugh would control of hollywood you should perhaps call his radio showto confirm this believe this is more criticism of hollywood and thedepraved moral values it espouses not an advocation of government control of hollywood liberals on the other hand want to have complete government control of our school systems so that the government can teach the people at anearly age the right way to view religion and morality believe mr limbaugh is against this as his satirical use of the young heads fullof mush hyperbole indicates on the news meida hitler the activity of the so called liberal press was the work of gravediggers for the german people and the german reich one can pass by in silence the marxist papers of lies its task is only to break the peoples folkish and national spine in order to make it ripe for the yoke of slavery of international capital and its masters the jews page pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here with an implicit plea forgovernment power to be used to break up the conspiracy limbaugh elements of the media have jumped on the bandwagon of leftist causes the cynical journalist of the past has been replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes during the gulf war cnn correspondent bernard shaw said cnn is global network we cant take sides cant take sides if they dont realize that their freedom lies in the united states of america and that therefore they should defend this nation they are hopelessly misguided and may suggest flirting with megalomania pages and indication here that elements of the media since career is self perhaps an inferred larger percentage than represented inthe populace at large has leftist bias doesnt sound too unreasonable no insinuation that cnn should not report in an objective fashion onlythat for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in thesituation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal you may disagree and it may well be exagerrated but it is not an unreasonable opinion and mr limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his audience knows that these are his opinions unlike most other reporting that purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree or other in statistical sense reflect the biases of the reporters who is being disingenuous here mr shaw or mr limbaugh again you should ask mr limbaugh himself but expect that he wouldoppose government control of the media to continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible but ultimately too depressing to take in one reading it is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome liberal arrogance liberals love to play games with paradigms as way of discrediting peoplewho disagree with them why dont you challenge conservative ideologyon an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in thatthey exist in your mind not the real world after putting these books down there is one undeniable fact that haunts me in the adolf hitler fed depressed and frightened germans the opiate of hatred of those around them in turn it allowed germans to hand their collective national power to the nazis in the rush limbaugh is doing the very same thing distributing hatred to depressed and frightened americans in turn it is helping the american radical right to maintain its power base as the year nightmare of the reagan bush era comes to an end hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for the fascist states of america perhaps there are few among the intellectually challenged who percieverush limbaugh as hate monger but in my experience he has been at the ludicrous self importance of the left not hatred as to mr bush you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings mr reagan on the other hand did his best to reverse the fascist trendof government involvement in business mr clinton is increasing fascismin america through business government partnership and increased levelsof taxation perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classesin grade school and if limbaugh is not as repellant hitler it is only because the radical right utilizes limbaugh as its own gateway opiate one can only wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook america on hmmm seems to me that limbaugh is not in any way comparable to hitlerbecause he has not murdered six million jews and many many others out ofracism come from mixed race family so am quite well attuned toracism dont hear any coming from rush limbaugh the only place hear racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the liberal left the liberal left is the movement see trying to get america hookedon the opiates of socialized medicine socialized transportation etc the left already has america hopelessly addicted to that liberal drug the social security chain letter it is quite clearto me that while the hitler analogy does not really apply to either rush limbaugh or william jefferson clinton if one of the two is closer than the other it is clearly the fascist clinton the madison edge can be reached at po box madison wi this is the same address as idiots anonymous isnt it

alt atheism ,organization california institute of technology pasadenalines nntp posting host punisher caltech edulivesey solntze wpd sgi com jon livesey writes much though it might be fun to debate capital punishment itself this is probably the wrong group for it the only relevance here is that you dont seem to be able to tell us what capital punishment actually is and when it is murder that is when you tell us murder is wrong you are using term you have not yet defined well ive said that when an innocent person has been executed this isobjectively murder however who is at blame is another question it seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions realizing the risks is to blame there is probability of killing an innocent person by shooting at random into the air and there is probability of killing an innocent person when the state administers system of capital punishment so when you do either you know that they actions you are taking will sooner or later result in the killing of an innocent person yes but there is also probablity that you will kill someone doingany raondom activity presumably you had not isolated yourself totallyfrom the rest of society because of this and driving will kill people as will airlines but people continue to do both driving and flying are not punishments inflicted on unwilling prisoners by courts they are risks that we take upon ourselves willingly and argue that our law system is similar risk perhaps an innocentperson will be punished someday but we work to prevent this in fact many criminals go free as result of our trying to prevent punishmentof innocents if our own driving kills someone else then sure there is moral issue know at least one person who was involved in fatal accident and they felt vey guilty afterwards but such accidents are to be totally expected given the numner of vehicalson the road again the blame is on society no im not this is what you said you were saying that if there were such false witness that resulted in an innocent person being convicted and killed it would still be the fault of the state since it did the actual killing no just commented that the state does the killing it does not depend on there being false witnesses how could it the state does the killing even in the case of sincere mistakesyes but the state is not at fault in such case the state can only doso much to prevent false witnesses it is possible so what are you trying to say that capital punishment is always murder because of the possibilty of human error invalidating the system im saying capital punishment is murder period not because of this that and the other but because it involves taking human life thats my definition of murder make no appeals to dictionaries or to objective morals okay so this is what you call murder but the question is whether or notall such murders are wrong are you saying that all taking of human lifeis wrong no matter what the circumstances if we as society decide to murder someone then we should say that and lists our reasons for doing so and live with the moral consequences we should not play word games and pretend that murder isnt murder and thats my opinion about how society ought to be run but this is basically how it works society accepts the risk that aninnocent person will be murdered by execution and every member ofsociety shares this blame and most peoples definitions of murderinclude some sort of malicious intent which is not involved in anexecution is it but we were trying to discuss an objective moral system or at least its possibilty what ramifications does your personal system have on an objective one no we were not discussing an objective moral system was showing you that you didnt have one because for one thing you were incapable of defining the terms in it for example murder murder violates the golden rule executions do not because by allowingit at all society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who theinnocent victim is were not talking about reading minds we are just talking about knowing the truth yes we can never be absolutely certain that we have the truth but the court systems work on principle of knowing the truth beyond reasonable doubt sorry but you simply are not quoting yourself accurately here is what you said and since we are looking totally objectively at this case then we know what people are thinking when they are voting to execute the person or not if the intent is malicious and unfair then the execution would be murder what you are doing now is to slide into another claim which is quite different the jury being persuaded beyond serious doubt is not the same as us knowing what is in their minds beyond serious doubt reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not convictionwas moral or not but in an objective system only the absolute truthmatters and the jury system is one method to approximate such truth thatis twelve members must be convinced of truth moreover jury which comes from sufficiently prejudiced background may allow itself to be persuaded beyond serious doubt on evidence that you and would laugh at but then if we read the minds of these people we would know that theconviction was unfair but would it be perfectly fair if we could read minds if we assume that it would be fair if we knew the absolute truth why is it so much less fair in your opinion if we only have good approximation of the absolute truth its not question of fairness your claim which have quoted above is claim about whether we can know it was fair so as to be able to distinguish capital punishnment from murder yes while we could objectively determine the difference if we knew allpossible information we cant always determine the difference in ourflawed system think that our system is almost as good as possible but it still isnt objectively perfect you see it doesnt matter ifwe know it is fair or not objectively it is either fair or it is not now theres huge difference if we can read minds we can know and if we cannot read minds we can know nothing the difference is not in degree of fairness but in what we can know but what we know has no effect on an objective system think it is possible to produce fairly objective system if we are clear on which goals it is supposed to promote im not going to waste my time trying to devise system that am pretty sure does not exist why are you so sure simply want people to confront reality my reality remember why is your reality important in this case the reality is that ideal theories apart we can never know even after the fact about the fairness of the justice system for every innocent person released from death row there may have been dozen innocent people executed or hundred or none at all we simply dont know but we can assume that the system is fairly decent at least most likely and you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about atotally ideal and objective system now what are we going to do on the one hand we can pretend that we have an ideal theory and that we can know things we can never know and the justie system is fair and that we can wave magic wand and make certain types of killing not murder and go on our way well we can have an ideal system but the working system can not be ideal we can only hope to create system that is as close an approximation tothe ideal system as possible on the other hand we can recognize that all justice has small we hope probability of punishing the innocent and that in the end we do bear moral responsibility even for the probabilistic consequences of the systems we set up and then say well here we go murdering again maybe some of us will even say gee wonder if all this is strictly necessary yes we all bear the responsibility most people seem willing to do this think that the second is preferable in that if requires people to face the moral consequences of what we do as society instead of sheltering ourselves from them by magic ceremonies and word games we must realize the consequences of all our actions why do you keepseparating the justice system from the pack and lest forget also dont think we have an objective moral system and believe only have to take that idea seriously when someone presents evidence of it dont think our country has an objective system but think such anobjective system can exist in theory without omniscience an objectivesystem is not possible in practice keith

extent of februarys killings of azeris by armeniansin the town of hojali is at last emerging in azerbaijan about men women and children dead in the worst outrage of thefour year war over nagorny karabakh the figure is drawn from azeri investigators hojali officialsand casualty lists published in the baku press diplomats and aidworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates the february attack on hojali by armenian forces was one ofthe last moves in their four year campaign to take full controlof nagorny karabakh the subject of new round of negotiationsin rome on monday the bloodshed was something between fightingretreat and massacre but investigators say that most of thedead were civilians the awful number of people killed was firstsuppressed by the fearful former communist government in baku later it was blurred by armenian denials and grief wild and contradictory allegations of up to dead the state prosecuter aydin rasulov the cheif investigator of man team looking into what azerbaijan calls the hojalidisaster said his figure of people dead was minimum onpreliminary findings similar estimate was given by elmanmemmedov the mayor of hojali an even higher one was printed inthe baku newspaper ordu in may dead people named and morethan bodies reported unidentified this figure of nearly dead is quoted as official by leila yunusova the new spokeswomanof the azeri ministry of defence francois zen ruffinen head of delegation of the cross in baku said the muslim imam of the nearby city ofagdam had reported figure of bodies received at his mosquefrom hojali most of them civilians we did not count thebodies but the figure seems reasonable it is no fantasy mrzen ruffinen said we have some idea since we gave the body bagsand products to wash the dead mr rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of thenumber of dead in the massacre dont get worked up it willtake several months to get final figure the year oldlawyer said at his small office mr rasulov knows about these things it took him two years toreach firm conclusion that people were killed and wounded when soviet troops and tanks crushed in baku in january those nationalists the popular front finally came to powerthree weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactlywhat happened when hojali an azeri town which lies about miles from the border with armenia fell to the armenians officially people have so far been certified as dead beingthe number of people that could be medically examined by therepublics forensic department this is just small percentageof the dead said rafiq youssifov the republics chief they were the only bodies brought to us remember thechaos and the fact that we are muslims and have to wash and buryour dead within hours of these people were women and were children under years old gunshots killed people shrapnel killed andaxes or blunt instruments killed exposure in the highlandsnows killed the last three thirty three people showed signs ofdeliberate mutilation including ears noses breasts or penisescut off and eyes gouged out according to professor those bodies examined were less than third of thosebelieved to have been killed mr rasulov said files from mr rasulovs investigative commission are lists of azeri militiamen are dead here sixpolicemen there and in handwriting of mosque attendant thenames of corpses brought to be washed in just one day themost heartbreaking account from witnesses interviewed so farcomes from towfiq manafov an azeri investigator who took ahelicopter flight over the escape route from hojali on february there were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground tocount properly in hojali people by the streamand the road and visible around nakhchivanik village mrmanafov wrote in statement countersigned by the helicopterpilot people waved up to us for help we saw three dead children andone two year old alive by one dead woman the live one waspulling at her arm for the mother to get up we tried to land butarmenians started barrage against our helicopter and we had toreturn there has been no consolidation of the lists and figures incirculation because of the political upheavals of

tightening around the to people left in the straggling azeri town on theedge of karabakh at about pm bombardment started such as we had never heardbefore eight or nine kinds of weapons artillery heavymachine guns the lot mr sadikov said soon neighbours were pouring down the street from the directionof the attack some huddled in shelters but others startedfleeing the town down hill through

com timothy may writes but is it any worse than the current unsecure system it becomes much worse of course if the government then uses this clinton clipper to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption this is the main concern of most of us think the camels nose in the tent etc not to pick on mr may in particular of course but isnt this kind of the domino theory when one little country falls its neighbor will surely follow and before you know it were all mining salt in siberia for not turning in our captain crunch secret decoder rings wish could agree with you ask yourself this why would any privatesector entity wish to buy crypto system that was known to be at leastpartially compromised key escrows in this instance why would anyprivate sector entity wish to buy crypto system that had not been algorythm not publically released the answer seems obvious to me they wouldnt there is other hardware outthere not compromised des as an example triple des as better one my suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clippersystems if not were in trouble given that the clinton administration is not entirely stupid although wed liketo think so cannot believe that they have failed to realize this they know their initiative will fail much as crippled des was never takenseriously the only way their moves can work is by coercion you knowlittle about politics if you dont realize that this is just first stepin the next move it makes no sense otherwise the next move banningor severly crippling crypto not using the clipper system is easilyjustified why would anyone want other encryption unless they were tryingto subvert the government weve provided you with very secure alternativeso use it or go to jail be fined whatever how can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providinglaw enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper systemthe only crypto available in the you simply cant and the it anyone who wanted to keep the govt out of their hair be it fordrug dealing or whatever would just buy still available non clipper systems dont sell our crafty clinton types short they cant be that stupid either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the is about that of potato why do you think at jumped on so fast they know its going to be big and not because its better right on the face of it noone will buy thestuff that doesnt have to at must know this too think man why thehell would they jump the gun my interpretation andrew tim may whose sig block may get him busted in the new regime isnt this just little melodramatic really wonder to wit the letter just sent to clinton the white houseoffice of the press secretary presidential comment line fax april sir and or madam must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption andcryptography am shocked at the clinton regimes increasing lean towards authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life it is apparent to me that those who drafted the clipper chip proposal which is incidentally gaining notoriety as the big brother proposal are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that key step in the development of new algorithm especially one destined for standardization is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors the proper evaluation of an algorithm depends on careful scrutiny by these sectors and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm the assumption that new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from experts without full disclosure is plain ignorance in addition the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology such as des when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy it seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow no matter how tamper proof the key escrows might be cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws can only assume then that the drafters of the clipper chip proposal knew very well the difficulties of selling crippled system to the private sector the only way this proposal makes any sense or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not utilize the big brother chip unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing expect the big brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the american people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like harmony right to encryption and voluntary it mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the clinton administration is cant believe its happening here more startling is question colleague of mine posed and the

soc religion christian ,organization youngstown state youngstown free netlines with franks permission have added some information here and inone case changed the order of his contributions in order to clarifythe historical relationship of the views my comments are basedprimarily on william ruschs historical summary in the fortress im going to save this as an faq clh major views of the trinity second centurythe writers of the nd cent are important because they set up muchof the context for the later discussions justin martyr aristides athenagoras tatian and theophilus of antioch are known as the apologists their theology has often been described as logostheology based strongly on wording in john they took more or lessa two phase approach through eternity the logos was with thefather as his mind or thought this immanent word became expressed as god revealed himself in history ultimately in jesus thus jesus full distinction from the father only became visible inhistory though the logos had been present in god from eternity rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of thefinal orthodox position but in form which is less sophisticated because it did not have the technical language to properly deal withthe eternal plurality in the godhead irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the apologists however hewas uncomfortable with the two stage approach he still viewed god asone personage with distinctions that did not become fully visibleexcept through his process of self revelation the economy thedistinctions are present in his essential nature irenaeus emphasizedthe holy spirit more than the apologists irenaeus views shouldprobably be called economic trinitarianism though that term isnormally used as below to refer to later developments third century clh dynamic monarchianism source paul of samosota artemon socinus modern of gods essence the unity of god denotes both oneness of natureand oneness of person the son and the holy spirit therefore with the fathers divine essence only as impersonal attributes the divine dunamis came upon the man jesus but he was not god in the strictsense of the word perception of gods subsistence the notion of subsistent god is since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible thediversity of god is apparent and not real since the christ event and thework of the holy spirit attest only to dynamic operation within god not toa hypostatic union asignation of deity eternality father unique originator of the universe he is eternal self existent andwithout beginning or end son virtuous but finite man in whose life god was dynamically present ina unique way christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified holy spirit an impersonal attribute of the godhead no deity or eternalityis ascribed to the holy spirit criticism elevates reason above the witness of biblical the trinity categorically denies the deity of christ and of theholy spirit thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the of salvation in summary this probably best thought of as not being all god is an one son and holy spirit are seenas simply names for the man jesus and the grace of god active in thechurch clh modalistic monarchianism source noatus sabellius swedenborg scleiermacher united pentecostals jesus only perception of gods essence the unity of god is ultra simplex he isqualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person thisessence may be designated interchangeably as father son and holy spirit they are different names for but identical with the unified simplex god thethree names are the three modes by which god reveals himself perception of gods subsistence the concept of subsistent god is erroneousand confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of gods modalistic manifestingof himself the paradox of subsisting three in oneness is refuted byrecognizing that god is not three persons but one person with three differentnames and corresponding roles following one another like parts of drama asignation of deity eternality father fully god and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation ofthe only unique and unitary god son full deity eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being anothermode of the one god and identical with his essence he is the same godmanifested in temporal sequence specific to role incarnation holy spirit eternal god only as the tile designates the phase in which theone god in temporal sequence manifested himself pursuant to the role ofregeneration and sanctification criticism depersonalizes the godhead to compensate for its this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical itsconcept of successive manifestations of the godhead cannot account for appearances of the three persons as at christs baptism rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy there areactually two slightly different groups included noetus and hisfollowers and sabellius noetus was apparently more extreme sabellius followed him and attempted to use some features of to create more sophisticated view unfortunately information about sabellius comes from century later and thereseems to be some confusion between him and marcellus of ancyra clh ive moved the following description to be with the otherthird century views it originally appeared near the end clh economic trinitarianism source hippolytus various neo economic of gods essence the godhead is characterized by triunity father son and holy spirit are the three manifestations of one identical indivisible substance the perfect unity and are in such manifest triadic deeds as creation and redemption perception of gods subsistence subsistence within the godhead is articulatedby means of such terms as distinction and distribution the notion of separateness or division asignation of deity eternality the equal deity of father son and holy spirit is clearly elucidated inobservation of the simultaneous relational operational features of thegodhead co eternality at times does not intelligibly surface in thisambiguous view but it seems to be logical implication criticism is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of therelational aspect of the trinity note that this is development of the apologists and irenaeus asmentioned above as with them the threeness is visible primarily inthe various ways that god revealed himself in history however theydid say that this is manifestation of plurality that is somehowpresent in the godhead from the beginning tertullian talks ofthe father son and holy spirit as being three that are one insubstance many people regard this view as being but with less developed philosophical categories clh origen developing further an approach started by clement attemptedto apply neo platonism to christian thought he set many of the termsof the coming battle in platonic fashion he sees the son as amediator mediating between the absolute one of god and the pluralityof creating beings the son is generated but he is that is the relationship between father and son iseternal it cannot be said that there was once when he was not aphrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries having the sonis intrinsic to his concept of god the father and son are describedas separate hypostases though this may not have quite the meaningof separate subsistence that it had in some contexts the union isone of love and action but there is some reason to think that he mayhave used the term homoousios of the same substance the holyspirit is also an active personal substance originated by the fatherthrough the son origens intent is trinitarian not tritheistic buthe pushes things in the direction of separateness fourth century clh often called arianism clh source ariusmajor adherents modern jehovahs witnesses and several other lesser of gods essence the inherent oneness of gods nature is with the father only the son and the holy spirit are who do not share the divine essence perception of gods subsistence the unipersonal essence of god precludes theconcept of divine subsistence with godhead threeness in oneness is self contradictory and violates biblical principles of monotheistic god asignation of deity eternality father the only one unbegotten god who is eternal and without beginning son created being and therefore not eternal though he is to be venerated he is not of the divine essence holy spirit nonpersonal noneternal emanation of the father he is viewedas an influence an expression of god deity is not ascribed to him criticism it is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respectingthe deity of both christ and the holy spirit its hierarchial concept likewiseasserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the father christ and the holy spirit this results in totally confused soteriology note also that in most versions of this view the son is not fullyhuman either he is supernatural and sinless that distinguishes thisview from adoptionism clh orthodox trinitarianism source basil gregory of nyssa gregory of nazianzus augustine thomasaquinas luther calvin contemporary orthodox of gods essence gods being is perfectly unified and simplex ofone essence this essence of deity is held in common by father son and holyspirit the three persons are consubstantial coinherent co equal and co eternal perception of gods subsistence the divine subsistence is said to occur inthree modes of being or hypostases as such the godhead exists undivided individed persons this view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperationin function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the godhead asignation of deity eternality in its final distillation this view unhesitatingly sets forth father son and holy spirit as co equal and co eternal in the godhead with regard to boththe divine essence and function criticism the only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent inhuman language and thought itself the impossibility of totally describing theineffable mystery of three in oneness at least in the th cent there were several different approaches allof which fit the description here and all regarded as orthodox but whichare somewhat different in detail nicea was originally held to respondto arius arius can be thought of as carrying origens thought bittoo far to the point of making the son separate entity in generalthe east tended to take an approach based on origens and it was hardto get acceptance of nicea in the east its final acceptance wasbased on the work of athanasius with the cappadocians gregory of nyssa andgregory of nazianzus among others while starting with three they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that onemust think of them as being single god this allowed the councilof constantinople in to get wide agreement on the idea ofthree hypostatese and one ousia clh adapted from of christian theology and doctrine_ by wayne house frank if one

talk religion misc ,summary another inerrantist rewrites the bible keywords scripture implication prophesy woof organization rowan college of new brandy the wonderdog hopes his doghouse will be rebuilt lines there has been lot of discussion about tyre in sum ezekiel prophesiedthat the place would be mashed and never rebuilt as there are lot ofpeople living there it would appear that ezekiel was not literally correct this doesnt bother me at all because understand the language ezekiel useddifferently than do so called biblical literalists for example it that someone says my grandson is the cutest baby and then turnsaround and sees the granddaughter and says oh isnt she the cutest thing this person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in theworld according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied forfirst rather he is trying to express his emotions using words that are veryobject oriented because this example is one that is common to many people nobody misunderstands the intent of the statements the bible however isoften at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be true for those people the existence of tyre is problem for me it is not turning to the latest person trying to defend ezekiel we read this fromjohn king the prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the area no it implies nothing of the kind if you had nothing but the prophecy fromezekiel and you were told you interpret it literally you would never say oh he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stufflike that you would read will make you bare rock and you will neverbe rebuilt and youd conclude that tyre would be bare rock the only wayto get from fishing nets to houses and buildings and medium largepopulation is if you know that all that latter stuff is there in other words your answer means that ezekiel misled everybody who read theprophecy at the time it was written there is no way that given literalreading they could read this passage and conclude medium size city you seem to feel that never be rebuilt means be rebuilt maybe so butit is hardly clear implication mr king also writes so far ive seen stated figurers ranging from to lets assume the latter one is correct by modern standards we are talking about one horse town well no thats only bit less than the population of annapolis where imfrom you know the naval acadamy the state capital george his commission in the statehouse annapolis may not be new york butits at least two horse town but supposing people is small town its still peoplemore than ezekiel predicted and youve said nothing about the other problem in chapter ezekielpredicts that nebuchadnezzar will will destroy tyre and loot all theirvaluables however nebuchadnezzar did not destroy tyre and in chapter ezekiel even quotes god as saying he and his army got no reward from thecampaign he led against tyre lets ignore alexander for moment and just pay attention to chapter ezekiel says would destroy tyre and did not destroy tyre ezekiel saysthat would plunder their valuables but did not plunder their valuables regardless of what you think about tyre the fact is that died beforethe place was destroyed ezekiel said was going to do it and did not this post is of course pointless inerrantists have an amazing abilityto rewrite the bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say for example expect mr king to respond to the comments about ezekiel by pulling some clear implications out of hat when ezekiel said that would demolish your towers that clearly impliedthat the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towersused to be and when ezekiel said that would demolish your fine housesand throw your stones timber and rubble into the sea that clearly impliedthat would never set foot on the island and when ezekiel wrote that would build ramp up to your walls that clearly implies that wouldspend years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to thewalls see few clear implications that are totally contrary to the text andyou can reconcile anything you want darren provine kilroy gboro rowan edu do you know why im the enabler because you demand it cliff claven

soc religion christian ,organization harvard university science centerlines in article may geneva rutgers edu db andrew cmu edu andrew byler writes mike walker if you are using the standard formula of fully god and fully human that im not sure why you object to saying that jesus was human think the usual analysis would be that sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity its consequence of the fall jesus is human but not fallen human clh differ with our moderator on this thought the whole idea of god comingdown to earth to live as one of us subject to sin and death as one ofthe consecration prayers in the book of common prayer puts it wasthat jesus was tempted but did not succumb if sin is not part of thebasic definition of humanity then jesus fully human nicea would notbe subject to sin but then the resurrection loses some of its meaning because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin to human and fallen human makes jesus less like one of us at thetime we need him most these issues get mighty subtle when you see people saying different things its often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things or whether they are using different terminology dont think theres any question that there is problem with nestorius and would agree that the saying christ had human form without real human nature or will is heretical but id like to be bit wary about the copts armenians etc recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had thought nestorius was an extreme representative of one of the two major schools of thought more moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox theodore of mopsuestia my impression is that the modern monophysite groups inherit the entire tradition not just nestorius version and that some of them may have sufficient balanced position to be regarded as orthodox clh first the monophysites inherited none of nestoriuss version they were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him second the suggests that the positions attributed to nestorius were not asextreme as his successful opponents who wrote the conventional history claimed mainly nestorius opposed the term theotokos for mary arguing think correctly that human could not be called mother of god mean in the athanasian creed we talk about the son uncreate surely even arians would concede that jesus existed long before mary anyway claimed that by saying mary was not theotokos that he claimedthat she only gave birth to the human nature of jesus which would requiretwo seperate and distinct natures the argument fails though becausemary simply gave birth to jesus who preexisted her either divinely if you accept nestorianism as commonly defined or both natures intertwined la chalcedon second am not sure that nestorianism is not better alternative thanthe orthodox view after all find it hard to believe that pre incarnationthat jesuss human nature was in heaven likewise post ascension thinkrather that god came to earth and took our nature upon him it was seperatenature capable of being tempted as in gethsemane since believe the divinenature could never be tempted but in its moments of weakness the divine natureprevailed comments on the above warmly appreciated jason albert there may be differences in what we mean by subject to sin theoriginal complaint was from someone who didnt see how we could calljesus fully human because he didnt sin completely agree thatjesus was subject to temptation simply object to the idea that bynot succumbing he is thereby not fully human believe that you donot have to sin in order to be human again apologize for confusing nestorianism and monophysitism iagree with you and have said elsewhere that theres reason to thinkthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was infact heretical there are scholars who maintain that nestorius wasnot nestorian have to confess that the first time read some ofthe correspondence between nestorius and his opponents thought hegot the better of them however most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led tochalcedon was an advance and that nestorius was at the very least rash and dogmatic as the editor of the christological controversy refers to him in rejecting all approaches other than his own asregular usenet readers know narrowness can be just as much animpediment as being wrong furthermore he did say some things that ithink are problematical he responds to rather mild letter fromcyril with flame worthy of usenet in it he says to attribute alsoto the logos in the name of the incarnation the the flesh that has been conjoined with him is my brother either the work of mind which truly errs in the fashion of thegreeks or that of mind diseased with the insane heresy of arius andapollinaris and the others those who are thus carried away with theidea of this association are bound because of it to make the divinelogos have part in being fed with milk and participate to somedegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of hisfearfulness these things are taken falsely when they are put offon the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for uswho perpetrate the falsehood its all well and good to maintain proper distinction betweenhumanity and divinity but the whole concept of incarnation is basedon exactly the idea that the divine logos does in fact have to somedegree part in being born growing up and dying of course itmust be understood that theres certain indirectness in the in these things but there must be some sort between the divine and human or we dont have anincarnation at all nestorius seemed to think in black and whiteterms and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with thisarea you say find it hard to believe that pre incarnation that jesusshuman nature was in heaven dont think thats required byorthodox doctrine its the divine logos that is eternal clh

act as fascist armenian governmental crony in this forum you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed this is not lecture to another historical revisionist and genocide apologist but fact this time fascist soviet armenian government will not get away with the genocide of azeri men women and children not chance the sunday times march morgues fill as azeris head for all out war thomas goltz the first to report the massacre by armenian soldiers in the worst violence since the breakup of the soviet union reports from agdam khojaly used to be barren town with empty shops and treeless dirt roads yet it was still home to thousands of people who in happier times tended fields and flocks of geese last week it was wiped off the map as sickening reports trickled in to the azerbaijani border town of agdam and the bodies piled up in the morgues there was little doubt that khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been the site of the most terrible massacre since the soviet union broke apart was the last westerner to visit khojaly that was in january and people were predicting their fate with grim resignation zumrut ezoya mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the town called her community sitting ducks ready to get shot she and her family were among the victims of the massacre on february the armenians have taken all the outlying villages one by one and the government does nothing balakisi sakikov father of five said next they will drive us out or kill us all said dilbar his wife the couple their three sons and three daughters were killed in the assault as were many other people had spoken to it was close to the armenian lines we knew we would have to cross there was road and the first units of the column ran across then all hell broke loose bullets were raining down from all sides we had just entered their trap the azeri defenders picked off one by one survivors say that armenian forces then began pitiless slaughter firing at anything moved in the gullies video taken by an azeri cameraman wailing and crying as he filmed body after body showed grizzly trail of death leading towards higher forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge from the armenians the armenians just shot and shot and shot said omar veyselov lying in hospital in agdam with sharapnel wounds saw my wife and daughter fall right by me people wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the loved ones some vented their fury on foreigners where is my daughter where is my son wailed mother raped butchered lost azerbaijan has said as many as refugees were killed as they tried to flee the armenians have denied this saying the civilians were caught in crossfire source the times march corpses litter hills in karabakhanatol lieven comes under fire while flying with azerbaijani forces to investigate the alleged mass killings of refugees by armenian troops as we swooped low over the snow covered hills of nagorno karabagh we saw the scattered corpses apparently the refugees had been shot down as they ran an azerbaijani film of the places we flew over shown to journalists afterwards showed dozens of corpses lying in various parts of the hills the azerbaijanis claim that as many as have died in mass killing of azerbaijanis fleeing from the town of khodjaly seized by armenians last week further are believed to be wounded frozen to death or missing seven of us squatted in the cabin of an azerbaijani attack helicopter as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings suddenly there was thump against the underside of the aircraft red flash of tracer ripped past the starboard wing and the helicopter rocked sharply we swung round and there was deafening burst of fire from the cannon under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire we had been fired on from an armenian anti aircraft post we swung round again tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into valley the brown earth swooped around our heads the helicopter swung round again and followed the contours of the ground our cannon fired repeated blasts later it emerged that civilian helicopter that we had been escorting had landed successfully at nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed enclave of nagorno karabakh to pick up some of the dead we had in fact been attacked both by ground fire and by an armenian helicopter had seen the armenian helicopter intermittently through the window its cannons firing but had thought mistakenly that it was on our side our group of western journalists had embarked on search and rescue flight that had become combat mission our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two soviet attack helicopters in the azerbaijani service nicknamed flying crocodiles for their armour our party was in the second crocodile the civilian helicopters job was to land in the mountains and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings the attack helicopters were there to give covering fire if necessary the operation showed striking sign of the disintegration of the soviet armed forces because our pilot was russian officer an azerbaijani official told us that there were now five former soviet military helicopters and their pilots fighting for azerbaijan they have signed contracts to fly for us he said the helicopter we engaged in combat was most probably flown by brother officer of our russian pilot but fighting for the armenians we had taken off just before pm on saturday from agdam airfield an heated for the armenian controlled mountains of karabakh sheer white wall in the distance the civilian helicopter picked up four corpses and it was during this and previous mission that an azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies on the hillsides we then took off again in hurry and speed back towards azerbaijani lines azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before the plain and safety gazed up at us as we passed back at the airfield in agdam we took look the bodies the civilian helicopter had picked up two old men small girl were covered with blood their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor mortis they had been shot what did our

sci crypt ,xxmessage id ac ac harding eff org xxdate fri apr gmtnntp posting host harding eff orgorganization electronic frontier foundationx useragent nuntius lines april initial eff analysis of clinton privacy and security proposalthe clinton administration today made major announcement oncryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security ofmillions of americans the first part of the plan is to begin acomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such asexport controls which have effectively denied most people easy access torobust encryption and law enforcement issues posed by new technology however eff is very concerned that the administration has alreadyreached conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry before anypublic comment or discussion has been allowed apparently is going to use its leverage to get all vendors to adopt voice encryption standard developed by thenational security agency the so called clipper chip is an bit split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into by military contractor two separate escrow agents wouldstore users keys and be required to turn them over law enforcement of valid warrant the encryption scheme used is to beclassified but the chips will be available to any manufacturer into its communications products this proposal raises number of serious concerns first the administration has adopted solution before conducting aninquiry the nsa developed clipper chip may not be the most secureproduct other vendors or developers may have better schemes furthermore we should not rely on the government as the sole source forthe clipper or any other chips rather independent chip be able to produce chipsets based on open standards second an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested yet proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified effbelieves that any standard adopted ought to be public and open thepublic will only have confidence in the security of standard that isopen to independent expert scrutiny third while the use of the use of split key dual escrowed system mayprove to be reasonable balance between privacy and law the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it isadopted what will give people confidence in the safety of their keys does disclosure of keys to third party waive an individuals fifthamendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries these are but fewof the many questions the administrations proposal raised but fails toanswer in sum the administration has shown great sensitivity to the importanceof these issues by planning comprehensive inquiry into digital privacyand security however the clipper chip solution ought to beconsidered as part of the inquiry and not be adopted before thediscussion even begins details of the proposal escrowthe bit key will be divided between two escrow agents each of whomhold bits of each key the manufacturer of the communications devicewould be required to register all keys with the two independent escrowagents key is tied to the device however not the person using it upon presentation of valid court order the two escrow agents wouldhave to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents according tothe presidential directive just issued the attorney general will beasked to identify appropriate escrow agents some in the suggested that one non law enforcement federal agency perhaps thefederal reserve and one non governmental organization could be chosen but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet classified algorithm and the possibility of back doorsthe administration claims that there are no back doors means by whichthe government or others could break the code without securing keys fromthe escrow agents and that the president will be told there are noback doors to this classified algorithm in order to prove this administration sources are interested in arranging for an all star cryptocracker team to come in under security arrangement and examine thealgorithm for trap doors the results of the investigation would then bemade public the clipper chipset was designed and is being produced and sole source secret contract between the national security agency and two privatefirms vlsi and mycotronx nsa work on this plan has been underway forabout four years the manufacturing contract was let months ago

comp graphics ,organization silicon graphics inc lines nntp posting host deadhead asd sgi com my comment regarding dec was to indicate that might be open to other vendors that supported opengl rather than deal further with sgi opengl is graphics programming library and as such is great for the development of interactive graphics applications itis not however an indicator of performance as that will vary stronglyfrom machine to machine and vendor to vendor sgi is committed to highperformance interactive graphics systems and software tools so openglmeans that you can port easily from sgi to other platforms there is noguarantee that your performance would be comparable what am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we would be able to upgrade to multiprocessor version of the crimson without the assistance of fork lift truck if your sales representative truly mislead you then you should have avalid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local sgisales management team feel free to contact the local branch manager weunderstand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers so give it ashot im also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around for while rather than being flushed as one of the previous posts stated the personal iris was introduced in and grew to include the and as clock ratessped up over time as rule of thumb sgi platforms live for about years this was true of the motorola based series the pi the professional series the early ds the powerseries parallel systems individual cpu subsystems running at aparticular clock rate usually live for about years new at the high end gt vgx realityengine are released every months to years these are the facts of life if we look at these machines they becomealmost archaic after four years and we have to come out with newplatform like indigo onyx challenge which has higher bus bandwidths faster cpus faster graphics and and larger disk capacities if wedont we become uncompetitive from the user perspective you have to buy machine that meets yourcurrent needs and makes economic sense today you cant wait to buy butif you need guaranteed upgrade path for the machine ask the sales repfor one in writing if its feasible they should be able to do that someof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them such asthe performance protection program for older based power systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtaina guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new onyx or challenger based bit multiprocessor systems now understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing positive quarterly bottom line odd that found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter but im just little tired of getting boned in the process if thats happening its becausing of ormis communication not because sgi is directly attempting to annoy ourcustomer base maybe its because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies so we arent entitled to peek under the covers as the big kids nasa for instance are this lab and suspect that lot of other labs and organizations doesnt have load of money to spend on computers every year so we cant be out buying new systems on regular basis most sgi customers are onesy twosey types but regardless we rarely give agreat deal of notice when we are about to introduce new system becauseagain like previous post stated if we pre announced and the scheduleslipped we would mess up our potential customers schedules when they werecounting on the availability of the new systems on particular date andwould also look awfully bad to both our investors and the who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting ourcommitments the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond that means that need to buy the best piece of equipment that can when have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one previous posters words to fill niche to compete with some other vendor im going to be looking at this box for the next five years and every time look at it im going to think about sgi and how could have better spent my money actually your money since were supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars five years is an awfully long time in computer years new are arriving every years making year old computer atleast and probably generations behind the times the competitive natureof the market is demanding that rate of development so if your timing isreally years between purchases you have to accept the limited viabilityof whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor there are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to livewith but keeping customers happy is the most important so dont give up we know it josh

the maple leafs thoroughly en route to shutout tommy soderstrom will get credit for the shutout but he barely brokea sweat until the third period as the flyers defense kept the leafs frommounting any serious attack injuries pelle eklund is day to day with bruised thigh roster moves jason bowen was added to the lineup for his first nhl game jason was the flyerssecond pick in the first round th

period game summary if the flyers played like this every night theyd be in the playoffs thisyear the flyers hit everything that moved they created scoring chance afterscoring chance they snuffed out everything that the leafs tried to do jason bowen made good play on his first nhl shift that almost created goal he had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone but insteadof taking the shot he found brindamour crashing the net on the other side perfect pass and good shot across daren puppas body should have been agoal but puppa made great save reading the play garry galley gave the maple leafs th ranked power play the first chance whenhe hooked doug gilmour at the flyers lowly st ranked penalty killingunit was almost flawless the entire game and set the tone on this kill themaple leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots and the defense sweptaway every rebound after the power play the flyers got goal on an ugly play rod brindamourgave the puck to greg hawgood at the right point and he sent drive at thenet puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of josefberanek and bob rouse who were wrestling in the slot beranek was able toget his stick on the puck and push it out to dineen who was skating intothe slot from the right circle and he lifted backhander over puppa fora flyers lead at the flyers kept the pressure on and puppa was the only leaf keeping the flyersfrom building on their lead for while eventually things settled down anddefense prevailed each team got an occasional scoring chance but the goalieswere strong bowen started giving some lindros like checks in his own corners then lindros who was looking to avenge hit foligno gave him thought he hada chance to even the score he had foligno lined up at center ice leaned intohim and rode him into the center ice boards the only problem was that folignowas little far from the boards and mike mister mcgeough felt that itwarranted boarding call at the leafs couldnt get anything going on the power play as the flyers werevery aggressive for change on the kill with time running out in the period recchi carried through the neutral zoneand handed to lindros as they approached the leafs blue line they were ina crowd with wendell clark and jamie macoun lindros tried backhand passto recchi through the feet of macoun that connected to recchi but then clarkchecked recchi off the puck macoun then tried to clear but it was weak andwent right to mcgill who had manned the point he drove it from just insidethe blue line macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his owngoalie at shots were flyers in the period the flyers finally got their first chance on the power play when dave up rod brindamour in his offensive zone during the power play theflyers got cheated little when the puck popped up into the air and ericgloved it down but mcgeough thought it hit his stick above his head wecould see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his gloveand the replay confirmed but the faceoff went to the other end as time wasrunning out in the advantage lindros found galley with pass across the goalmouth but puppa made the save the rebound kicked back to the right corner whererecchi picked it up passed it out to eric crashing through the right circle and eric one timed past puppa at with the assist recchi moves pastbobby clarkes season the second best one season total for flyer at eric moves up to th all time in flyers rookie scoring with points mike eastwood took down al conroy at to give the flyers another chance onthe power play not much pressure before garry galley ended the power play witha slash at not much happened on the on although the leafs had mostof the possession the flyers smothered the leafs short power play tempersflared little at bowen and pearson got roughing minors keith actongot bloody face dave mcllwain then took dive and got greg hawgood ahooking minor at to set up on the replay showed that hawgoodsstick stopped making contact with mcllwain long before he spun around and fell again the flyers smothered the leafs power play led by dimitri yushkevich bowen made thundering hit when he came out of the box on pearson berehowskitried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball he had the puck at the point and just trickled pass down the slot he made all the flyers look silly asnobody could get stick on it and it got to gilmour at the side of the net but soderstrom stoned him the flyers picked things up offensively after the kill was over but didntget anything home shots were flyers the flyers were content with the goal lead in the third period and theydecided that if tommy wanted shutout he was going to have to work for it alittle the flyers got most of the scoring chances in the first or so minutes of theperiod but couldnt get past puppa then the leafs got tired of lindros makingroad kill out of them and tempers flared each for doug gilmour and lindros unsportsmanlike conduct and each for glenn anderson and mcgill roughing all at terry carkner then took kneeing penalty at on gilmour again the flyers smothered the leafs power play at about the minute mark dave andreychuk got shot away from his leftcircle that got through soderstrom the puck was rolling on its side andas luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towardsit think of how rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or theother seconds later rod brindamour tripped up gilmour at to give theleafs another chance on the power play on the advantage after andreychuk while lying down andreychuk got the rebound but from behind the net and it went straight through and was sweptaway by one of his defensemen they kept the pressure on but soderstrom wasequal and preserved the shutout recchi cross checked ken baumgartner to get tempers hot and start brawlat no punches thrown recchi got the initial minor and lindros each got roughing minors at rouse and their mutual dislike for each other and got each for slashing toset up another on mike eastwood shoved down ryan mcgill in the flyerszone as they were battling for the puck and while mcgill was down he ranhis stick across mcgills face the flyers were not happy with that at all al conroy paired up with berehowski and started throwing punches upward well al held his own much to the delight of the crowd each gota couple punches in before going down in head and al got standing penalties eastwood cross check game clark carkner each berehowskiand conroy each fighting at so major penalty for the rest of the game for the flyers the had no interestin stting on the lead hawgood galley and brindamour played catch untilhawgood found dineen all alone in the left circle he controlled the puck andblasted it past puppa at that was all the fireworks tommy soderstrom would not face another shot puppadid but kept the flyers off the board flyers shots were flyers in the rd probably the strongest game ive seen from the flyers since the all starbreak shutout number for soderstrom all since tied for nd most inthe nhl but hes played fewer games than belfour or the goalie cantremember that hes tied with next up its the winnipeg selannes tuesday night in winnipeg the flyers cannotbe eliminated if they win but loss coupled with an islander win that nightin washington would be the official end flyers up to points on the season in games last year they had pointsin games under so they need at least points in their last games to improve on that only by percentage points under in is betterthan under in tragic number holds at points with games left the tragic number for this points watched the rangers blow third period lead at home tolose before finished this up why points instead of well the flyerswill win the tie breaker if they catch them whereas the islanders win tiebreakers against the flyers and so need only tie the rangers could crumbledown the stretch as they play the devils the pens twice the flyers

soc religion christian ,organization freshman civil engineering carnegie mellon pittsburgh palines dave davis writes let my state my point as provocatively as possible after going through several study bibles im leaning heavily towards the assertion that the wisdom of ben sira or ecclesiasticus is directly referenced by in fact think sirach is more directly referenced by james than or is referenced in any nt verse ive seen good point the new testament does not quote ezra nehemiah esther ruth job ecclesiastes or song of songs just as it does not quotefrom the deuterocanon but if the non quotation of the former does notdisqualify them neither does the non quotation of the later and thewisodm of solomon was quite clearly an influence on st paul especiallyin the letter to the romans cf especially romans and wisdom stuff deleted think everyone would agree that principles that cannot be consistently applied are not very useful as principles so if we are to exclude them not accord them the authority of scripture we would appear to require other reasons what might these reasons be tradition always fav with episcop tradition is equivocal on this subject sirach believe is in vaticanus sinaiticus dont know if it is listed in the muratorian canon the oldest list know of sirach and the others are discussed by the fathers as scripture but not unanimously true not all accepted them as scripture though niether were all thebooks of the new testament so accepted which puts to the lie the wholeargument of the books being excluded because they were debated and notuniversally accepted hebrews the apocalypse peter esther andothers were debated at various times but eventually retained as forthe codexes you mention both vaticanus and sinaitcus include thedeuterocanon bothe of the new and old testaments and vaticanus ithink inlcudes clement the shepard of hermas and the epistle ofbaranabas as for the muratorian canon it deals with the new testamentonly though it is very valuable in its witness to those books my interim conclusion is that protestant exclusion of at least one of these writings is one of those traditions of men one hears of so often they were excluded during the reformation and that appears to be the reason many people continue to exclude them any takers can be reasonable if all else fails show me where im wrong youre not wrong it is tradition of men to exlcude them as iwill explain below that nothing be read in the church under the nmae of divine scripture except the canonical scriptures and the canoncial scriptures are genesis exodus leviticus numbers deuteronomy joshua judges ruth four books of kingdoms being samuel and kings two books ofparalpomenon being chronicles job the psalter of david the fivebooks of solomon being proverbs ecclesiastes song of songs wisdom ofsolomon and misatributed to him the wisdom of jesus son of sirach the books of the twelve minor prophets isaiah jeremiah beingjeremiah the lamentations baruch and the letter all of which wereformerly counted as one ezekiel daniel tobit judith esther twobooks of ezra being ezra and nehemiah two books of maccabees and ofthe new testament four books of the gospel one book of the acts of theapostles thirteen letters of paul the apostle one letter of the sameto the hebrews two of peter the apostle three of john one of theapostle jude one of the apostle james one book of the apocalypse ofjohn council of hippo statute ad this same list was promulgated again at the third council of carthage ad and at the sixth council of carthage ad at whichcouncil the same list was enumerated with the words because we haverecieved from the fathers that these are the books to be read in thechurch which ought to quiet those who assert in the name of holyscripture we do understand those books of whose authority there wasnever any doubt in the church as the episcopal church does in removingthe deuterocanon from the realm of scripture though the them in high regard and read them in the church they are notcounted as scripture by them and may not be used to prove dogma thelutherans hold out similarly earlier mention of the so called apocrypha as divine scripture can alsobe found and below inlcude only portion of the quotes calling itdivine scripture that could be found among the writings of the fathers and this is the reason why the law of the old testament is reckoned asconsisting of twenty two books so that they may correspond to thenumber of letters in the hebrew alphabet it is to be noted alsothat by adding to these tobias and judith there are twenty four books corresponding to the number of letters used by the greeks st hillary of poitiers commentaries on the psalms prologue ad the twenty two books according to the hebrews are jeremiah and the letter reckoned as one and also there ismaccabees origen commentaries on the psalms psalm ad divine scripture addressing itself to those who love themselves and tothe boastful says most excellently baruch follows st clement of alexandria the instuctor of children ad learned accurately the books of the old testament proverbs ofsolomon and also wisdom st melito of sardes fragment found in eusebius history of thechurch and dating from crica ad book it is likewise decreed now indeed we must treat of the what the universal catholic church accepts and what she mustshun the list of the old testament wisdom one book ecclesiasticus one book tobit one book judith one book ofmaccabees two books st damasus pope the decree of damsus section ad would think this enough though more can be shown that the churchhas always accepted the deutero canon though parts have been disputedby various persons for if disputes involving the new canon does not disqulaify those books hebrews james peter john jude revelation in protestant eyes than neithershould it disqulaify the old testament books and must point out thatthe jews only drew up their canon in ad years after the foundingof the christian religion upon the cross why should we adhere to acanon that was drawn up by the faithless in reaction to the chrsitianuse of the greek septuagint which includes the deutero canon as earlyas ad st justin had already accused the jews of mutilating thecanon of scripture by their removal of certain books prefer to think that gods revelation was limited by decreeof the jews in the ordering of their the jews faithless canon andthat he could not use other people like the apostles in drawing up thecanon the apostles were most certain users of the septuagint as some of the old testament quotes use the wording of the septuagint andnot the hebrew and the septuagint includes the deuterocanon

attack com wrote now what am interested in is the original notion you were discussing on moral free agency that is how can god punish person for not believing in him when that person is only following his or her nature and it is not possible for that person to deny what his or her reason tells him or her which is that there is no god think youre letting atheist mythology confuse you on the issue of webster myth traditional or legendary story belief whose truth is accepted uncritically how does that qualify indeed its almost oxymoronic rather amusing instance ive found that most atheists hold almost no atheist views as accepted uncritically especially the few that are legend many are trying to explain basic truths as myths do butthey dont meet the other criterions also divine justice according to the most fundamental doctrines of christianity when the first man sinned he was at that time theyou accuse him of referencing mythology then you procede tolaunch your own xtian mythology this time meeting all therequirements of myth salvation the idea of punishment is based on the proposition that everyone knows instinctively that god exists is their creator andah but not everyone knows that god exists so you havea fallacy theres nothing terribly difficult in all this and is well known to any reasonably biblically literate christian the only controversy isand that makes it true holding with the bible rules out controversy read the faq if youve read it you missed something so re read not bad suggestion for anyone re read it just before this with those who pretend not to know what is being said and what it means when atheists claim that they do not know if god exists and dont know what he wants they contradict the bible which clearly says that everyone knows the authority of the bible is its claim to be should repeat what wrote above for the sake of gettingit across you may trust the bible but your trusting it doesntmake it any more credible to me if the bible says that everyone knows thats clearly reasonto doubt the bible because not everyone knows your allegedgods alleged existance refuted while the species wide condemnation is justified those that claim that there is no evidence for the existence of god or that his will is unknown must deliberately ignore the bible the ignorance itself is no excuse no they dont have to ignore the bible the bible is farfrom universally accepted the bible is not proof of god it is only proof that some people have thought that therewas god or does it prove even that they might have beenwriting it as series of fiction short stories as in thecase of dionetics assuming the writers believed it theonly thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it and thats ignoring the problem of whether or not all and biblical philosophers were correct there are people who have truly never heard of the bible again read the faq freedom you are free to ignore god in the same way you are free to ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known in both cases that an atheist cant accept the evidence means onlybzzt wrong answer gravity is directly there it doesnt stop exerting direct andrationally undeniable influence if you ignore it god on theother hand doesnt generally show up in the supermarket excepton the tabloids god doesnt exert rationally undeniable influence gravity is obvious gods arent secondly human reason is very comforatble with the concept of god so much so that it is in itself intrinsic to our nature human reason always comes back to the question of god in every generation and inno human reason hasnt always come back to the existance of god it has usually come back to the existance of god in other words it doesnt generally come back to the xtiangod it comes back to whether there is any god and in muchof oriental philosophic history it generally doesnt pop up asthe idea of god so much as the question of what natural forcesare and which ones are out there from world wide view human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came tobe and or what force are currently in control naturaltendancy to believe in god only exists in religious wishfulthinking said all this to make the point that christianity is eminently reasonable that divine justice is just and human nature is much different than what atheists think it is whether you agree or notxtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions andits reasonableness certainly doesnt merit eminence divine justice well it only seems just to those who alreadybelieve in the divinity first not all atheists believe the same things about humannature second whether most atheists are correct or not you certainly are not correct on human nature you are atthe least basing your views on completely try

sci crypt ,organization at bell received the following two notes from martin hellman with detailson how clipper will work they are posted with his permission theimplications of some details are fascinating date sat apr pdtto long list of recipients most of you have seen the announcement in fridays ny times etc about nist national institute of standards technology announcing the clipper chip crypto device several messgeson the net have asked for more technical details and some havebeen laboring under understandable giventhe lack of details in the news articles so here to help outis your friendly nsa link me was somewhat surprised fridayto get call from the agency which supplied many of the missingdetails was told the info was public so here it is the cc of thisto dennis branstad at nist is mostly as double check on myfacts since assume he is aware of all this please let me knowif have anything wrong the clipper chip will have secret crypto algorithm embedded in silicon each chip will have two secret bit keys one will be the same for all chips ie system wide key and the other will be unit specific dont know what nist and nsa will call them but will call them the system key sk and unit key uk in this message the ic will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so that the system key can be kept secret aside it is clear that they also want to keep the algorithm secret and in my opinion it may be as much for that as this stated purpose the unit key will be generated as the xor of two bit random numbers and uk which will be kept by the two escrow authorities who these escrow authorities will be is still to be decided by the attorney general but it was stressed to me that they will not be nsa or law enforcement agencies that they must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased when law enforcement agency gets court order they will present it to these two escrow authorities and receive and thereby allowing access to the unit key uk in addition to the system key each user will get to choose his or her own key and change it as often as desired call this key plain old when message is to be sent it will first be encrypted under then will be encrypted under the unit key uk and the serial number of the unit added to produce three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key sk producing uk serial number sk when court order obtains and and thence the law enforcement agency will use sk to decrypt all information flowing on the suspected link aside it is my guess that they may do this constantly on all links with or without court order since it is almost impossible to tell which links over which message will flow this gives the agency access to uk serial numberin the above message they then check the serial number of the unit and see if it is on the watch list for which they have court order if so they will decrypt uk to obtain and then decrypt to obtain am still in the process of assessing this scheme so please do not take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed scheme all am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme more knowledgably but will say that the need for just one court order worries me would feel more comfortable though not necessarily comfortable if two separate court orders were needed one per escrow authority while no explanation isneeded the following story adds some color in researchingsome ideas that silvio micali and have been kicking around spoke with gerald gunther the constitutional law experthere at stanford and he related the following story whenedward levi became pres fords attorney general rightafter watergate he was visited by an fbi agent askingfor the wiretap authorizations when levy asked forthe details so he could review the cases as required bylaw the agent told him that his predecessors just turnedover blank signed forms every time levi did notcomply and changed the system but the lesson is clear no single person or authority should have the power toauthorize wiretaps or worse yet divulging of personalkeys sometimes he or she will be an edward leviand sometimes john mitchell martin hellman date sun apr pdtto smb

killed thousands wounded some azerbaijanis have been brutally and from the armenian ssr their historical homeland together with them russians and kurds have alsobeen driven out part of them now settled in azerbaijan some turkish meskhetians lezghins and representatives of other caucasian nationalities who escaped from the centralasia where the president and government bodies did not

is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of armenia onazerbaijan it is well documented fact that before the conflict therewere no frictions between armenians and azerbaijanis on theissue of karabakh hundreds and thousands armenians placidlyand calmly lived and worked in azerbaijan land had in all government bodies of the azerbaijanssr we are for united indivisible sovereign azerbaijan we are for common caucasian home proclaimed in by oneof the founding fathers of the azerbaijan democratic republic muhammed emin rasulzade but all these goals and expectations are trampled upon thesoviet leadership in favour of the armenian by moscow and intended to create new year reich the great armenia by annexing the neighboring lands the world public

they areless valuable can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion by their residence or otherattributes all people are brothers and we appeal to our brothersfor help and

the underdogs report taken from the new york times tuesday march massacre by armenians being reported agdam azerbaijan march reuters fresh evidence emerged today of massacre of civilians by armenian militants in nagorno karabakh predominantly armenian enclave of azerbaijan the republic of armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed people in the azerbaijani populated town of khojaly last week and massacred men women and children fleeing the carnage across snow coveredmountain passes but dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to of massacre scalping reported azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the regionby helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of theirheads blown off they said shooting by armenians has prevented them from retrieving more bodies women and children have been scalped said assad faradshev an aideto nagorno karabakhs azerbaijani governor when we began to pick up bodies they began firing at us the azerbaijani militia chief in agdam rashid mamedov said the bodiesare lying there like flocks of sheep even the fascists did nothing like this truckloads of bodies near agdam on the outskirts of

computer security bbs at the white house office of the press immediate release april statement by the press secretarythe president today announced new initiative that will bringthe federal government together with industry in to improve the security and privacy of while meeting the legitimate needs of lawenforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new products toaccelerate the development and use of advanced and networks and wireless communications links for too long there has been little or no dialogue between ourprivate sector and the law enforcement community to resolve thetension between economic vitality and the real challenges ofprotecting americans rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy andlaw enforcement previous policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer it is now being used toprotect electronic mail and computer files while can help americans protect business secrets and theunauthorized release of personal information it also can be usedby terrorists drug dealers and other criminals state of the art microcircuit called the clipper chip hasbeen developed by government engineers the chip represents anew approach to encryption technology it can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached toan ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many incommercial use today this new technology will help companies protect protect the privacy of personal phone prevent unauthorized release of data at the same time this technology preserves theability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals key escrow system will be established to ensure that the clipper chip is used to protect the privacy of law each device containing the chip will have two unique keys numbers that will be needed by authorized to decode messages encoded by the device when thedevice is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separatelyin two key escrow data bases that will be established by theattorney general access to these keys will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awiretap the clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the of americans to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology theattorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices in addition respected experts from outside thegovernment will be offered access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly reporttheir findings the chip is an important step in addressing the problem ofencryptions dual edge sword encryption helps to protect theprivacy of individuals and industry but it also can shieldcriminals and terrorists we need the clipper chip and otherapproaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with accessto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using itto hide their illegal activities in order to assess and explore new approaches like the key escrow system the president has directed government agencies to develop acomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and the need of companies to manufacture and export high technology products the president has directed early and frequent consultations withaffected industries the congress and groups that advocate theprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed the administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of national which will use new and to give americans unprecedented access toinformation this infrastructure of high speed networks information superhighways will transmit video images hdtvprogramming and huge data files as easily as todays telephonesystem transmits voice since encryption technology will play an increasingly importantrole in that infrastructure the federal government must actquickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regardingits use the administration is committed to policies thatprotect all americans right to privacy while also protectingthem from those who break the law further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet the provisions of the presidents directive to acquire the newencryption technology are also available for additional details call mat heyman national institute ofstandards and technology questions and answers about the clinton initiativeq does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations no clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans suppose law enforcement agency is conducting wiretap on drug smuggling ring and intercepts conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message they would have to obtain legal authorization normally court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system who will run the key escrow data banks the two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks how strong is the security in the device how can be sure how strong the security is this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities whose decision was it to propose this product the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved in this decision this approach has been endorsed by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials who was consulted the congress industry we have on going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them who provides the clipper chip mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future how do buy one of these encryption devices we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the clipper chip into their devices if the administration were unable to find technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices this is fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration is developing the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the saying that every american as matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product there is false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administrations policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the same is true for other encryption devices one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on case by case basis for companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad we plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products
