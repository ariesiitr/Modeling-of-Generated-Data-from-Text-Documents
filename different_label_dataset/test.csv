number of reported cases of gonorrhea in colorado increased from to after declining steadily during the in comparison in the united states reported cases of gonorrhea in continued an overall decreasing trend this report summarizes an analysis of the increase in gonorrhea in colorado in and characterizes trends in the occurrence of this disease from through in cases of gonorrhea were reported to the colorado department of health cdh compared with cases reported in during reported cases increased and among females and males respectively table similar increases occurred among blacks whites and hispanics and respectively however the number of reported cases with race not specified increased from to and constituted of all reported cases in although the largest proportional increases by age groups occurred among persons aged years and greater than or equal to years these age groups accounted for only of all reported cases in persons in the year age group accounted for the largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during and the highest age group specific rate per reported cases of gonorrhea increased in the five county denver metropolitan area population but decreased elsewhere in the state table half the cases of gonorrhea in the denver metropolitan area occurred in of the census tracts these represent neighborhoods considered by sexually transmitted diseases stds acquired syndrome aids field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity when compared with the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among men in the denver metro health clinic dmhc the primary public std clinic in the denver metropolitan area increased in and the number of visits by males to the clinic increased concurrently the number of cases diagnosed among women increased by among self identified heterosexual men the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at dmhc increased and comprised of all cases diagnosed in males while the number of cases diagnosed among self identified homosexual men remained low and in and respectively four selected laboratories in the metropolitan denver area hmo university hospital nonprofit family planning and commercial were contacted to

surveillance and information systems br div of sexually transmitted diseases and hiv prevention national center for prevention svcs cdc editorial note the increase in reported gonorrhea cases in colorado in may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by cdh surveillance staff during the increases in confirmed gonorrhea cases at dmhc and in culture positivity rates in three of four laboratories suggest real increase in gonorrhea rather than reporting artifact however the stable culture positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning laboratory which serves network of clinics statewide indicates that the gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population one possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado may be gang and drug related sexual behavior as implicated in recent outbreak of drug resistant gonorrhea and other stds in colorado springs although the high morbidity census tracts in the denver metropolitan area coincide with areas of gang and drug activity this hypothesis requires further assessment to examine the possible role of drug use implicated previously as factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis the cdh std aids program is collecting information from all persons in whom gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use exchange of sex for money or drugs and gang affiliation the gonorrhea rate for blacks in colorado substantially exceeds the national health objective for the year per objective race is likely risk marker rather than risk factor for gonorrhea and other stds risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at greatest risk for stds and for targeting prevention efforts moreover race specific variation in std rates may reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic status access to medical care and high risk behaviors in response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado interventions initiated by the cdh std aids program include targeting partner notification in the denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at increased risk year old black females and year old black males implementing media campaign public service radio hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april announcements signs on city buses newspaper advertisements and posters in

disease and injury prevention impact of adult safety belt use on restraint use among children less than years of age selected states and source mmwr date apr motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children and young adults in the united states and account for more than million years of potential life lost before age annually child safety seats and safety belts can substantially reduce this loss from through all states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety belts for children although these laws reduce injuries to young children by an estimated motor vehicle crash related injuries remain major cause of disability and death among children while the use of occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age usage for those aged years aged years and aged years in addition parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to use restraints for their children to characterize the association between adult safety belt use and adult reported consistent use of occupant restraints for the youngest child aged less than years within household cdc analyzed data obtained from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system brfss during and this report summarizes the findings from this study data were available for respondents aged greater than or equal to years in states that participated in brfss population based random digit dialed telephone survey and administered standard injury control and child safety module developed by cdc of these respondents had child aged less than years in their household each respondent was asked to specify the childs age and the frequency of restraint use for that child the two categories of child restraint and adult safety belt use in this analysis were consistent use always buckle up and less than consistent use almost always sometimes rarely or never buckle up data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state software for survey data analysis sudaan was used to calculate point estimates and confidence intervals statistically significant differences were defined by values of less than each of the states had some type of child restraint law of these six arizona kentucky maine nebraska rhode island and west virginia had no law requiring adults to use safety belts four idaho maryland pennsylvania and washington had secondary enforcement mandatory safety belt law vehicle had to be stopped for traffic violation before citation for nonuse of safety belts could be issued and one state new york had primary enforcement mandatory safety belt law vehicles could be stopped for safety belt law violation alone in nine states child passenger protection hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april laws included all children aged less than years but the other two states used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use the analysis in this report subgrouped states into those having law requiring adult safety belt use law states and those without such law no law states overall of children aged less than years reportedly were not consistently restrained during automobile travel both child restraint use and adult restraint use were significantly higher less than chi square test in law states than in no law states versus and versus respectively high rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than consistent safety belt use figure adults with consistent use reported high rates of child occupant restraint use regardless of the childs age range for year olds to for year olds in comparison for adults reporting less than consistent safety belt use the rate of child occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child range for year olds to for year olds when comparing children of consistent adult safety belt users with children of less than consistent adult safety belt users confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age groups aged less than and year reported child occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded that in no law states regardless of age of child table in addition higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with increased restraint use for children factor that has also been associated with increased adult safety belt use reported by national center for injury prevention and control national center for chronic disease prevention and health promotion cdc editorial note the findings in this report are consistent with others indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to employ occupant restraints for their children because these nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit other risk taking behaviors children traveling with them may be at greater risk for motor vehicle injury educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with child restraint use in this report accordingly occupant protection programs should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment because low educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status such programs should be offered to adults through health care facilities that serve low income communities or through federal programs head start that are directed at parents with young children injury prevention programs emphasize restraining young children in addition however efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april they become older parents especially those with low educational attainment those who do not consistently wear safety belts and those from states that do not have mandatory safety belt use laws should be encouraged to wear safety belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and safety belts finally the increased use of

developed surveillance systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects reporting period covered this report covers birth defects surveillance in metropolitan atlanta georgia and selected jurisdictions in california for the years description of system the california birth defects monitoring program and the metropolitan atlanta congenital defects program are two population based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods the prevalence estimates for diagnostic categories were based on data for for births in california and births in metropolitan atlanta the prevalences in the two areas were compared adjusting for race sex and maternal age by using poisson regression results regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis fetal alcohol syndrome hip dislocation dysplasia microcephalus obstruction of the kidney ureter and scoliosis lordosis may be attributable to general diagnostic variability however differences in the prevalences of arm hand limb reduction encephalocele spina bifida or trisomy down syndrome are probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment because these defects are relatively easy to diagnose interpretation regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination may affect prevalences of trisomy and spina bifida however the reason for differences in arm hand reduction is unknown but may be related to variability in environmental exposure heterogeneity in the gene pool or random variation actions taken because of the similarities of these data bases several collaborative studies are being implemented in particular the differences in the birth prevalence of spina bifida and down syndrome will focus attention on the impact of prenatal diagnosis authors

identification of influenza viruses weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and territorial epidemiologists and from sentinel family practice physicians nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received throughout the year results during the influenza season influenza and viruses were identified in the united states with essentially equal frequency overall although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted over the course of the season throughout the season increases in the indices of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza predominated were similar to increases in regions where influenza predominated only of identified viruses were influenza but isolations of this subtype increased as the season waned and it subsequently predominated during the season during the season outbreaks in nursing homes were reported in association with influenza and but not influenza interpretation the alternating temporal and geographic predominance of influenza strains and during the season emphasizes the importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance since amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza actions taken weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make informed choices

high tech assisted reproductive the birth of the first in vitro fertilization embryo transfer ivf et baby in host of assisted reproductive technologies have been developed that include ivf et gamete intrafallopian tube transfer gift embryo freezing and gamete together these technologies are referred to as the high tech assisted reproductive technology art procedures ovulation induction sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and or pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility management however when these fail it almost always is appropriate to proceed with one of the art procedures therefore in addition to comprehensive basic and general infertility service at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility there is program of assisted reproduction that specializes in art procedures this program serves as tertiary provider for those patients in the state of arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the traditional therapies the following article on back describes the art procedures available in our center clarifies appropriate applications for each and considers the realistic expectations for their success procedures included are in vitro fertilization embryo transfer ivf et gamete intrafallopian tube transfer gift of human embryos and gamete this article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed towards improved success of these technologies hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april future areas of researchin addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the management of infertile couples we are developing the technology to assist couples who are at risk for producing embryos with serious hereditary disease this technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either dna amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization there are recent reports of the successful application of dna amplification by other centers for example for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and hemophilia we hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ hybridization technology for probing the chromosome the identification of which will provide scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit sex linked disorders the considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis in addition to the possibility of subsequent termination of affected fetuses in order to avoid the birth of affected children catherine racowsky ph associate professor and director of of obstetrics and of medicine university of arizonatucson arizona applications success rates and advances for the management of infertilitythe following are the art procedures available at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility in vitro fertilization embryo transfer is the core art procedure of our assisted reproduction program this procedure involves retrieval of unfertilized eggs from the ovary their insemination in vitro in dish and the culture of resultant embryos for or days before they are transferred to the patients uterus all cultures are maintained in an incubator under strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions before being processed for use in insemination semen samples are evaluated in our andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april assisted semen analyses to ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to perform ivf et or indeed gift follicular development is typically stimulated with gonadotropins perganol metrodin gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh factrel lutrepulse and or gnrh analogues lupron depo lupron synarel occasionally however ivf et is accomplished with eggs obtained in non stimulated cycles while some programs utilize laparoscopic egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound guided retrieval in our infertility unit with the patient sedated couples who resort to ivf et exhibit such pathologies as tubal deficiencies ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis and or mild forms of male factor infertility according to the united states ivf registry the overall success rate for ivf et nationwide has stabilized at about percent per cycle results from our program involving patients who have undergone ivf et cycles reflect comparable success rate nevertheless the overall incidence of success with this procedure is disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological factors that limit achievement of higher percentage of pregnancies well recognized predictors of outcome include patient age response to exogenous ovarian stimulation quality of sperm and number of repeated ivf et cycle attempts however among these age is the single most significant determinant of conception therefore it is critical that such patients are referred to an assisted reproduction program at the earliest opportunity following failure of traditional therapies the underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not been clearly delineated beyond recognition that the number of eggs available for retrieval declines markedly with age fertilization rates significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over years and provided the appropriate hormonal background is present age is unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy ongoing research in our center therefore is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may be impacted by age we have determined that more than percent of eggs that fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal and that significant proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age currently the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from donor our program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs of list of recipients interested in this form of therapy gift this high tech art procedure is performed in the operating room usually with the use of laparoscope and in contrast to ivf et involves introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the fallopian tube an average of eggs tube under these circumstances fertilization occurs in vivo and if excess eggs are retrieved the remainder undergo ivf with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle or freezing for transfer in subsequent cycle this art procedure is applied to cases in hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april which there is at least one patent fallopian tube but the couple has such pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis male factor infertility and or idiopathic infertility the data reported in the united states ivf registry for through indicate that the overall success rate with gift is higher than that obtained with the ivf et technique range of clinical pregnancies for gift is to percent and for ivf et to percent in view of this fact one might expect more patients to be treated with gift than ivf et however in our program we have taken into account three basic concerns which while substantially reducing the number of gift cycles performed benefit the patient these concerns are the increased costs associated with performing procedure in the operating room the risks albeit minimal of undergoing general anesthesia and the considerable benefits to be accrued from obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs and the developmental competency of resultant embryos the increased success with gift undoubtedly reflects the artificial environment provided by the laboratory in the ivf et procedure between january and december we have performed total of gift cycles with an overall success rate of percent embryo or freezing is applied in our program when embryos result from residual gift eggs or from non transferred ivf embryos this procedure not only provides patients with subsequent opportunity for success at much reduced costs but also circumvents the legal and ethical issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos therefore as stipulated by the american fertility society ethical guidelines for art programs from both practical and an ethical standpoint all assisted reproduction programs should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys gamete this art procedure which is still very new is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but who have severe male factor infertility less than million sperm ml in combination with fewer than perccent motile sperm and or less than percent sperm with normal morphology we are currently developing the procedure of sub zonal insertion szi which entails injecting sperm under the coating around the egg the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm through enzymatic digestion available data from szi programs world wide indicate that only to percent of szi cycles result in pregnancy this statistic undoubtedly relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm therefore we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation such efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to establish conception catherine racowsky ph hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april associate professor and director of of

alt atheism ,nntp posting host okcforum osrhe eduorganization okcforum unix users groupx newsreader tin version pl lines wainwright eczcaw mips nott ac uk wrote jim always thought that homophobe was only word used at act up rallies didnt beleive real people used it lets see if we agree on the terms definition homophobe is one who actively and militantly attacks homosexuals because he is actually latent homosexual who uses his hostility to conceal his true orientation since everyone who disapproves of or condemns homosexuality is homophobe your implication is clear it must necessarily follow that all men are latent homosexuals or bisexual at the very least crap crap crap crap crap definition of any type of phobe comes from phobia an irrational fear of hence homophobe not only in act up meetings the word is apparently in general use now or perhaps it isnt in the bible wouldst thou prefer if were to communicate with thou in bilespeak does an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of being spider does an agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being wide open space do you understand english obviously someone who has phobia will react to it they will do their best to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or run away or do gaybashings occur because of natural processes people who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or cause them or themselves violence isnt that what said what are you taking issue with here your remarks are to mine and add nothing useful it would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function other than limiting population growth since evolution only occurs when the members of one generation pass along their traits to subsequent generations homosexuality is an evolutionary deadend if take your usage of the term homophobe in the sense you seem to intend then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our species at least is going nowhere so every time man has sex with woman they intend to produce children hmm no wonder the world is overpopulated obviously you keep to the monty python song every sperm is sacred and if as you say it has purpose as means to limit population growth then it is by your own arguement natural consider the context im talking about an evolutionary function oneof the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of aspecies procreate those who dont have no purpose in that context another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to survive the participation of both parents is necessary family must exist since homosexuals do not reproduce they cannot constitute family since the majority of humankind is part of family homosexuality is an evolutionary abberation contrary to nature if you will well if that is true by your own arguements homosexuals would have vanished years ago due to non procreation also the parent from single parent families should put the babies out in the cold now cos they must by your arguement die by your argument homosexuality is genetically determined as to yoursecond point you prove again that you have no idea what contextmeans am talking about evolution the preservation of the species the fundamental premise of the whole process but it gets worse since the overwhelming majority of people actually prefer heterosexual relationship homosexuality is social abberation as well the homosexual eschews the biological imperative to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in the most fundamental social element the family but wait theres more read the above expect you to have at least ten children by now with the family growing these days sex is less to do with procreation admittedly without it there would be no one but more to do with pleasure in pre pill and pre condom days if you had sex there was the chance of producing children these days is just aint true people can decide whether or not to have children and when soon they will be able to choose its sex but thats another arguement so its more of lifestyle decision again by your arguement since homosexuals can not or choose not to reproduce they must be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children both are as unnatural as each other yet another non sequitur sex is an evolutionary function that existsfor procreation that it is also recreation is incidental thathomosexuals dont procreate means that sex is only recreation andnothing more they serve no evolutionary purpose since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some policy makers that they have civil rights they are now claiming that their sexuality is preference life style an orientation choice that should be protected by law now if homosexuality is mere choice and if it is both contrary to nature and anti social then it is perverse choice they have even less credibility than before they became prominent people are people are people who are you to tell anyone else how to live their life are you god tm if so fancy date heres pretty obvious dodge do you really think youve said anythingor do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement am nottelling anyone anything am demonstrating that there are the practice of homosexuality providing its merely analternate lifestlye that are not homophobic that one can reasonablycall it perverse in context even atheist can understand realizeof course that this comes dangerously close to establishing value and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis but if youare to be consistent you have no case in this regard to characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of the homosexual life style but since the charge is only intended to intimidate its really just demogoguery and not to be taken seriously fact is jim there are far more persuasive arguments for suppressing homosexuality than those given but consider this start again crap all your arguments are based on outdated ideals likewise the bible would any honest christian condemn the ten generations spawned by bastard to eternal damnation or someone who crushes his penis either accidently or not both are in deuteronomy im sure your comment pertains to something but youve disguised itso well cant see what where did mention ideals out dated orotherwise your arguments are very reactionary do you have anythingat all to contribute as to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in scouting the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from teaching by their own logic homosexuals are deviates social and biological since any adult is role model for child it is incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolated from those who would do the child harm in this case harm means primarily social though that could be extended easily enough you show me anyone who has sex in way that everyone would describe as normal and will take of my hat puma baseball cap to you one mans meat is another mans poison what has this got to do with anything would you pick single pointthat you find offensive and explain your objections

indiana edusupersedes jvk ey usenet ucs indiana edu nntp posting host silver ucs indiana edumime version archive name ripem attackslast update mar some possible attacks on ripem this is living list of potential weaknesses to keep your eyes openfor when using ripem for secure electronic mail it does not go intogreat detail and is almost certainly not exhaustive obviously manyof the weaknesses are weaknesses of secured mail ingeneral and will pertain to secure mail programs other than ripem it is maintained by marc vanheyningen mvanheyn cs indiana edu itis posted monthly to variety of news groups followups to ripem should go to alt security ripem cryptanalysis attacks breaking rsa would allow an attacker to find out your private key in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign messages with your private key rsa is generally believed to be resistant to all standard cryptanalytic techniques even standard key about bits with ripem is long enough to render this impractical barring huge investment in hardware or breakthrough in factoring breaking des would allow an attacker to read any given message since the message itself is encrypted with des it would not allow an attacker to claim to be you des has only bits in its key and thus could conceivably be compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware but few agencies have such money to devote to simply read one message since each message has different des key the work for each message would remain high key management attacks stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking rsa to safeguard it it is encrypted with des key which is derived from passphrase you type in however if an attacker can get copy of your private keyfile and your passphrase by snooping network packets tapping lines or whatever he could break the whole scheme the main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the private key file across an untrusted link so dont do that run ripem on trusted machine preferably one sitting right in front of you ideally your own machine in your own home or maybe office which nobody else has physical access to fooling you into accepting bogus public key for someone else could allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him rather than to the real recipient if the enemy can fool your intended recipient as well he could re encrypt the messages with the other bogus public key and pass them along it is important to get the proper public keys of other people the most common mechanism for this is finger assuming the opponent has not compromised routers or daemons or such finger can be given fair amount of trust the strongest method of key authentication is to exchange keys in person however this is not always practical having other people vouch for you by signing statement containing your key is possible although ripem doesnt have features for doing this as automatically as pgp ripem does generate and check md fingerprints of public keys in the key files they may be exchanged via separate channel for authentication playback attacks even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography an opponent could still cause difficulties for example suppose you send message with mic only pem mode which does not provide disclosure protection to alice which says ok lets do that your opponent intercepts it and now resends it to bob who now has message which is authenticated as from you telling him to do that of course he may interpret it in an entirely different context or your opponent could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later figuring it would be seen differently at later time or the opponent could change the originator name to himself register your public key as his and send message hoping the recipient will send him return mail indicating perhaps even quoting the unknown message to defeat playback attacks the plaintext of each message should include some indication of the sender and recipient and unique identifier typically the date good front end script for ripem should do this automatically imho as recipient you should be sure that the originator name header and the sender indicated within the plaintext are the same that you really are recipient and that the message is not an old one some this also can and should be automated the author of this faq has made modest attempt at automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated headers the programs are included in the standard distribution in the utils directory local attacks clearly the security of ripem cannot be greater than the security of the machine where the encryption is performed for example under unix super user could manage to get at your encrypted mail although it would take some planning and effort to do something like replace the ripem executable with trojan horse or to get copy of the plaintext depending how its stored in addition the link between you and the machine running ripem is an extension of that if you decrypt with ripem on remote machine which you are connected to via network or worse yet modem an eavesdropper could see the plaintext and probably also your passphrase ripem should only be executed on systems you trust obviously in the extreme case ripem should only be used on your own machine which you have total control over and which nobody else has access to which has only carefully examined software known to be free of viruses and so on however theres very real trade off between convenience and security here more moderately cautious user might use ripem on unix workstation where other people have access even root access but increase security by keeping private keys and the statically linked of course executable on floppy disk some people will keep ripem on multi user system but when dialing in over an insecure line they will download the message to their own system and perform the ripem decryption there however the security provided by such mechanism is somewhat illusory since you presumably type your cleartext password to log in youve just given away the store since the attacker can now log in as you and install traps in your account to steal your private key next time you use it from less insecure line this will likely remain the situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of cleartext password authentication find it nice to put brief statement of how carefully manage my security arrangement in my plan next to my public key so that potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are in place some people use two keys short one which is not carefully managed for ordinary use and longer one which is treated with greater care for critical correspondence untrusted partner attacks ripems encryption will ensure that only person with the private key corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the traffic however once someone with that key gets the message she may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes there exist no cryptographic barriers to recipient say taking an encrypted message and converting it to mic only message signed by you and readable by anyone although ripem does not provide this functionality indeed the latest pem draft have seen specifically states that such transformations should be possible to allow forwarding functions to work including the recipients in the plaintext as mentioned above will make it possible for recipients of redistributed message to be aware of its original nature naturally the security of the cryptography can never be greater than the security of the people using it

networks to malicious ends such as breaking into systems has been referred to as hacker but most internet users prefer the term cracker for this instead hacker is perceived as benign but intensely ambitious curious and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of system for example something of proud electronic pioneer and patriot this is the sense intended in this document see also the hackers dictionary and the faq alt security faq what is cypherpunk from the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list cypherpunks assume privacy is good thing and wish there were more of it cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy must create it for themselves and not expect governments corporations or other large faceless organizations to grant them privacy out of beneficence cypherpunks know that people have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers envelopes closed doors and couriers cypherpunks do not seek to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or their opinions see information on the cypherpunk mailing list below see also the cryptoanarchist manifesto and the cryptography glossary in soda berkeley edu pub cypherpunks what is steganography and anonymous pools closely associated with encryption is steganography or the techniques for not only pursuing private encrypted communication but concealing the very existence of the communication itself many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the proliferation of computer technology for example it is possible to encode messages in the least significant bits of images typically the most noisy in addition when such an item is posted in public place such as newsgroup virtually untraceable communication can take place between sender and receiver for steganographic communications in the electronic realm one another possibility is setting up mailing list where individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual users decode particular messages with their unique key an anonymous pool has been set up by miron cuperman miron extropia wimsey com for experiments send email to pool request extropia wimsey com with one of the following commands in the subject line subscribe unsubscribe help_____ what is security through obscurity security through obscurity refers to the attempt to gain protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information or programs relating to them for example company may not make public information on its softwares encryption techniques to evade attacks based on knowledge of it another example would be concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in operating systems or some reliance may be made on the fact that some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious because they are not widely known or not widely used this argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and usenet posting forgery security through obscurity is regarded as very feeble technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at worst also called the head in the sand approach see the faq for alt security some remarks of john perry barlow cofounder of the electronic frontier foundation directed to nsa agents at the first international symposium on national security national competitiveness held in mclean virginia dec digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep contained this stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile its almost life form in its ability to self propagate if something hits the net and its something which people on there find interesting it will spread like virus of the mind believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into an environment where any information which is at all interesting to people is going to get out and there will be very little that you can do about it this is not bad thing in my view but you may differ what are identity daemons rfc describes protocol standard that allows unix programs to query remote users login name after connection to local communication socket connection of this type is established during ftp and telnet sessions for example the standard is not widely supported perhaps of internet sites currently implement it but the number is increasing the mechanism is detrimental to anonymity regular users cannot disable it but system adminstrators can circumvent it this standard may represent trend toward greater authentication mechanisms what new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy remailing posting stable secure protected officially sanctioned and

sundevil the phoenix inspired crackdown of may concentrated on telephone code fraud and credit card abuse and followed this seizure plan with some success bulletin board systems went down all over america terrifying the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of their criminal instruments it also saddled analysts with some floppy disks and confronted harried justice department prosecutors with the daunting challenge of gigantic nationwide hacker show trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of jurisdictions massive show trials never materialized although isolated instances of prosecution were pursued the movement reached crescendo in texas with the highly publicized case of illegal search and seizure involving the steve jackson games company of austin texas on march from the column gurps labour lost by bruce sterling bruces well sf ca us in fantasy and science fiction magazine in an early morning raid with an unlawful and warrant agents of the secret service conducted search of the sjg office when they left they took manuscript being prepared for publication private electronic mail and several computers including the hardware and software of the sjg computer bulletin board system yet jackson and his business were not only innocent of any crime but never suspects in the first place the raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that somewhere in jacksons office there might be document compromising the security of the telephone system fbi agents involved in the seizure were named in civil suit filed on behalf of steve jackson games by the electronic frontier foundation see information on eff below from an article by joe abernathy in the houston chronicle feb austin an electronic civil rights case against the secret service closed thursday with clear statement by federal district judge sam sparks that the service failed to conduct proper investigation in notorious computer crime crackdown and went too far in retaining custody of seized equipment secret service special agent timothy foley of chicago who was in charge of three austin computer search and seizures on march that led to the lawsuit stoically endured sparks rebuke over the services poor investigation and abusive computer seizure policies while the service has seized dozens of computers since the crackdown began in this is the first case to challenge the practice sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the austin science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never suspected of crime and that agents did not do even marginal research to establish criminal connection between the firm and the suspected illegal activities of an employee or to determine that the company was publisher indeed agents testified that they were not even trained in the privacy protection act at the special secret service school on computer crime how long would it have taken you mr foley to find out what steve jackson games did what it was asked sparks an hour was there any reason why on march you could not return to steve jackson games copy in floppy disk form of everything taken did you read the article in business week magazine where it had picture of steve jackson law abiding tax paying citizen saying he was computer crime suspect did it ever occur to you mr foley that seizing this material could harm steve jackson economically foley replied no sir but the judge offered his own answer you actually did you just had no idea anybody would actually go out and hire lawyer and sue you more than has been spent by the

ripem allows your electronic mail to have the four security facilities provided by pem disclosure protection optional originator authenticity message integrity measures and non repudiation of origin always see what is pem ripem was written primarily by mark riordan mrr scss cl msu edu most of the code is in the public domain except for the rsa routines which are library called rsaref licensed from rsa data security inc the current version of ripem is the current version of the macintosh port of ripem is how can get ripem ripem uses the library of cryptographic routines rsaref which is considered munitions and thus is export restricted from distribution to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the or canada without an export license no such license has been obtained nor would one likely be granted unless the rsa key exchange were shortened to bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something weaker than des there are some suggestions that this situation may change now that clinton is in office the author requests in the readme file that this law not be violated please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution outside of the usa or canada this is personal request from me the author of ripem and condition of your use of ripem note that rsaref is not in the public domain and license for it is included with the distribution you should read it before using ripem ripem is available via anonymous ftp to citizens and permanent residents in the from rsa com cd to rsaref and read the readme file for info note that the non rsaref portion of ripem is not product of rsa data security incorporated they merely are helping distribute it ripem as well as some other crypt stuff has its home site on ripem msu edu which is open to non anonymous ftp for users in the and canada who are citizens or permanent residents to find out how to obtain access ftp there cd to pub crypt and read the file getting_access for convenience binaries for many architectures are available here in addition to the full source tree will ripem run on my machine probably it has already been ported to ms dos and most flavors of unix sunos next linux aix ultrix solaris etc ports to macintosh include standard unix style port and rather nice mac like port written by raymond lau author of stuffit more ports are expected and help of users is invited will ripem work with my mailer probably how easy and clean the effective interface is will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer though the users guide included with the distribution discusses ways to use ripem with many popular mailers including berkeley mush elm and mh code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of ripem inside gnu emacs if you make new interface for ripem or create an improvement on one in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use secure and may be useful to others feel free to post it to alt security ripem what is rsa rsa is crypto system which is asymmetric or public key this means that there are two different related keys one to encrypt and one to decrypt because one cannot reasonably be derived from the other you may publish your encryption or public key widely and keep your decryption or private key to yourself anyone can use your public key to encrypt message but only you hold the private key needed to decrypt it note that the message sent with rsa is normally just the des key to the real plaintext see what is des note that the above only provides for disclosure protection for originator authenticity message integrity and non repudiation of origin services to be implemented the fingerprint of the message see what is fingerprint like md is encrypted with the senders private key the recipient or dispute resolving authority can use the senders public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered rsa was named for the three men rivest shamir and adleman who invented it to find out lots more about rsa and modern cryptography in general ftp to rsa com and look in pub faq some information also may be in sci crypt what is des des is the data encryption standard widely used symmetric or secret key crypto system unlike rsa des uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages however des is much faster than rsa ripem uses both des and rsa it generates random key and encrypts your mail with des using that key it then encrypts that key with the recipients public rsa key and includes the result in the letter allowing the recipient to recover the des key des is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses key length considered too short by modern standards however it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than large corporation or government agency it is not likely that the pem standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the near future because there is strong feeling that pem should be stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with what is fingerprint like md md is message digest algorithm produced by rsa data security inc it provides bit fingerprint or secure hash of the plaintext it is secure because it is not possible in reasonable amount of computation to produce different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint thus instead of signing the entire message with the senders private key only the md of the message needs to be signed for authentication md can also be exchanged directly for authentication for example ripem public keys include an md of the public key in the file so parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via separate channel merely need exchange md of keys and verify their accuracy md is sometimes used for other purposes for example it is often used to map an input of arbitrary length to bits of data as passphrase interpreter or cookie generator md is described in its entirety including an implementation in in rfc there have been some recent suggestions that md may not be as strong hash as was originally believed presumably some other hash function will be used if this is accepted as true what is pem pem is privacy enhanced mail standard for allowing transfer of encrypted electronic mail generated over long period of time by working group of experts it is described in rfcs these documents have been approved and obsolete the old rfcs ripem is not really complete implementation of pem because pem specifies certificates for authenticating keys which ripem does not handle at this time their addition is planned whats this about distributing and authenticating keys for remote user to be able to send secure mail to you she must know your public key for you to be able to confirm that the message received came from her you must know her public key it is important that this information be accurate if bad guy convinces her that his key is in fact yours she will send messages which he can read ripem allows for three methods of key management central server the distributed finger servers and flat file all three are described in the ripem users guide which is part of the distribution none of them provide perfect security the pem standard calls for key management by certificates the addition of this feature to ripem is planned but chicken egg issues still exist isnt it bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like pem this issue has been considered in the standards process rfc the specification for internet standards has discussion section on what specifications for availability must be met for patented method to be included in standard rfc addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public key cryptography this does not of course mean that all questions are settled or that everyone is in agreement an interesting exchange on the use of patented algorithms in standards with regard to public key cryptography is in the league for programming freedom archive available via ftp ftp uu net doc lpf in the files bidzos letter and bidzos response amusingly the lpf files on ftp uu net are compressed with patented algorithm what about rsadsi pkp rsa data security inc rsadsi is california based company specializing in cryptographic technologies public key partners is firm which holds exclusive sub licensing rights of the following patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents cryptographic apparatus and method diffie hellman no public key cryptographic apparatus and method hellman merkle no cryptographic communications system and method rsa no exponential cryptographic apparatus and method hellman pohlig no pkp claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key cryptography the two businesses are rather closely related for example the same person jim bidzos is president of both of them pkp has licensed this technology to considerable number of companies ibm dec motorola at lotus for use in their products pkp has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their patents ripem was originally created with no connection to rsadsi other than its use of the rsaref library and for no reason other than its authors desire to see widespread use of public key cryptography however after the ball started rolling people at rsadsi got interested rsadsi decided to carry ripem on its ftp site and some people there started making their own ripem keys and contributing code ripem even won the best application built on rsaref in award why do all ripem public keys look very similar ripem public keys begin with pkcs public key cryptography standards identifier describing various characteristics about the key so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as those of lots of other peoples keys this does not mean your keys are similar but only that they are the same class of key were generated with the same program are of the same length etc what is pgp pgp is another cryptographic mail program called pretty good privacy pgp has been around longer than ripem and works somewhat differently pgp is not compatible with ripem in any way though pgp does also use rsa few major differences between pgp and ripem pgp has more key management features particularly for users without direct network connection ripem conforms to the pem rfcs and thus has greater probability of working with other pem software pgp makes no attempt to be compatible with anything other than itself ripem uses rsaref library of rsa routines from rsadsi which comes with license allowing noncommercial use pgp uses its own implementation of rsa pkp claims that it is violation of its patents to make use or sell pgp in the or canada without either license or written permission see disclaimer see what about rsadsi pkp phil zimmermann the author of pgp stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal action he believed that licensing scheme could be arranged but it hasnt happened and there seems little prospect of it happening in the future he acknowledges in the pgp users guide in fact if you live in the usa and you are not federal agency you shouldnt actually run pgp on your computer because public key partners wants to forbid you from running my software pgp is contraband both pgp and ripem are export restricted and cannot be sent outside the and canada without an export license however pgp already exists on many ftp sites in europe and other places whether you use pgp or ripem or whatever the documentation to pgp is recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues unfortunately its not distributed separately from the program which can be difficult to find in the on ftp sites due to liability concerns what about rpem rpem stands for rabin privacy enhanced mail it was similar to ripem but used public key cipher invented by rabin which is not rsa in an attempt to avoid the patents on public key systems it was written by mark riordan who later wrote ripem its distribution was halted when contrary to the beliefs of many including rabin pkp claimed that their patents were broad enough to cover the cipher employed this claim is not universally accepted but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons rpem is not really used anymore it is not compatible with ripem or pgp what is mime mime stands for multipurpose internet mail extensions and is described in rfc you can find out about it in the newsgroup comp mail mime faq exists on it how pem should interact with mime is not yet entirely clear some people use the stopgap solution of having mime type application ripem in order to send ripem messages as mime ones hope some standards will emerge draft internet documents exist on the matter what is tis pem trusted information systems is working on version of privacy enhanced mail for general availability last heard it was rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent mh rather than stand alone system and in beta test dont know much more than that have this simple way to defeat the security of ripem you may wish to check the companion post ripem attacks which discusses some of the more obvious attacks on ripems security and what procedures will minimize the risk ripems main weak area is probably key distribution

murray and jeff reardon oh yeah dave winfield marginal player guy didnt hit lick hadnegligible power was crap fielder and had no staying power dave winfield now entering his believe th big league season is still damn decenthitter admittedly his defense has slipped great deal but in his prime he had powerful arm and great range take look at the stats dont know where you even begin to make an argument that winfield and kingman aresimilar players kingman was one dimension power hitter he couldnt field he ran like an anvil hit for low average though if remember right hisobp wasnt that hideous and for those who consider such things important was absolute primo dick eddie murray yup only the best st baseman of the know thatmvp votes are conducted by mediots but given that he got jobbed out of themvp he deserved in it seems that he wasnt overrated by the media lee smith hmmmm this ones actually pretty close hes had ssolid dependable career as closer despite pitching in some nasty parks wrigley fenway id have to take closer look at the stats its been while but it seems lee arthur is of hof caliber you do make legitimate point about the hof credentials of relievers simply racking up lot of saves doesnt mean whole hell of lot if you blow bunch too simply because minnesota and boston and for month atlanta used reardon as closer for longer than he should have been one the equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves no way should homerman be in the hof imho darrell evans nice career actually bit underrated kinda liketed simmons imho but not hofer well in any case am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving hall of fame consideration to players that are by todays standards marginal lemme ask you this who the hell playing the game isnt marginal honestly ozzie smith and robin yount dont belong there theyre both shortstops that just hung around for long time big deal lets be little more selective huh stop handing out these honors so liberally save them for the guys who really deserve it face it if something now wait goddamn minute here ozzie smith absolutely redefined theposition of shortstop his defense was so good that hes won something alongthe lines of gold gloves again gold gloves are mediot biased and good argument could be made that larkin deserved one or two of ozzies morerecent awards but usually this is tempered by someone else in the early getting the gold gloves ozzie deserved earlier in his career ozziesoffense you ask good obp great speed numbers in park which for most of hiscareer depressed offense admittedly no power cept against tom niedenfuer but still definite asset offensively yount hits mvp at two different positions uh huh realstiff his was one of the great years ever by player in recent memory and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of wagner and banks as far asss numbers go hes clear hofer imho isnt done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore when certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential candidates the absurdity is apparent gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan well as far as garvey goes youre right garvey is mediot candidate pushed because of his winning attitude minor factor if oneat all and his great defense no errors admittedly but the range ofa tree stump garvey shouldnt be in the hof skyjack ive said lot of nasty things about skyjack in the lastyear or so but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talkabout morris ability to win which is nothing more than morris abilityto pitch when toronto to score tons of runs at this point morris is anaverage pitcher although from his early returns in he may be damned close to done but in all fairness morris was dominant pitcher in the for up and down tiger teams while was obviously great yearfor detroit the rest of the decade the team was generally in contention butnot favorites morris career numbers are quite good and worthy of hof consideration ryan of course but be careful guarantee you that someone willthrow back your earlier logic about yount and smith being shortstops who hung around long time after all nolan never won cy damn hes just pitcher who hung around for years his record is mediocre of course nolans hofer puck probably although hes got to play reasonably well for fewmore years years even good ones arent enough to make the hof mostlikely that said believe puckett will make the hof pretty muchregardless of how the rest of his career turns out barring something really tragic or sudden hes very popular in the media and with fans andlegitimately has been one of the best cfs in the game since he joined theleague ive always liked the guy and hope he does make it and in theend think the puck will make it in but really its too early to sell this debate comes up rather frequently on the net and believe it or not never tire of it its an interesting

soc religion christian ,organization nottingham universitylines in article may geneva rutgers edu you wrote the genius of science is that it discovered that enormous progress in knowledge could be made by isolating the study of physical interactions for the more general areas of study and proceeding not by logical argument but by experiment the scientific method is hypothesize attempt to disprove the hypothesis if you fail publish if others fail to disprove your hypothesis accept it as working theory and move on this method is suitable only for the study of objects without will objects which do not take an interest in the experiment science does not progress via experimentation but by philosophising oneaim of experiments is to investigate the validity of the from the models produced by this thinking process the arrogance of science is the assumption many advocates of science make that the scientific method is the only method of serious study the only one leading to knowledge rather than belief science has one advantage of all other approaches to explaining the world it is objective its further arrogance is the assumption which arises that since science is the only valid method of thought everything which exists must be the sort of thing which the scientific method can study and that if the scientific method cannot study it it either does not exist or cannot in any way be known anything which affects the physical world can be studied for example since we are part of the physical world anything including spirits whichaffects our behaviour can be observed science does not make any claimsabout the existence or non existence of objects which do not affect thephysical world since these asumptions about the nature of the world cannot themselves be made the subject of experiment it is bad science to believe them as well as arrogance illogic and just plain sloppy thinking the purpose of science is to produce model of the physical world themodel must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcomeof future observations one of the aims of experiments is to carry outwell defined observations which are objective ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world andthe model which realises on the minimal number of assumptions at themoment models which do not rely on the assumption of some spiritual worldexisting are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of spiritual world as the non spiritual models has fewer assumptions itshould be the currently accepted models the scientific process never assumes that its present models are thecorrect ones whereas many religions claim to represent the truth thearrogance of many theists is that they claim to represent the truth thiscannot be said of scientists steve langslang sling slink slick slack shack shank thank think thick

be all bad seriously im not sure whether misjudged you or not in one respect still have major problem though with your insistence that science is mainly about avoiding mistakes and still disagree with your contention that nobody who doesnt use methods deemed scientific can possibly know whats true and whats not deleted material which agree with back to lee lady these are not the rules according to many who post to sci med and sci psychology according to these posters if its not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then its not science these posters are making the mistake that have previously criticized of adhering to methodological recipe carefully rules such as support the hypothesis by carefully designed and controlled study are too narrow to apply to all investigation think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things to reuse the previous example we know that conclusions from uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical problems are notoriously problematic okay so lets see if we agree on this first of all there are degrees of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify preliminary judgement thata treatment is useful this is often the best evidence we can hope forfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support in this case it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as crediblebut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who arequalified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing secondly it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for pronounced effect than for one that is marginal come to this dispute about what science is not only as amathematician but as veteran of many arguments in sci psychology andoccasionally in sci med about nlp neurolinguistic programming muchof the work done to date by nlpers can be better categorized asinformal exploration than as careful scientific research for yearsnow have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists tojust take look at it to read few of the books and watch some ofthe videotapes courtesy of your local university library not forthe purpose of making definitive judgement but simply to look at thenlp methodology especially the approach to eliciting information fromsubjects and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be ofscientific interest and most especially to be aware of the questions nlp suggests which might be worthy of over and over again the response get in sci pychology is if thishasnt been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of then it cant be of any interest to us to me the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme thereve got tobe controlled studies position is an nlp technique called the fastphobia trauma cure simple phobias as opposed to agoraphobia may not be the worlds most important psychological disorder but the nice thing about them is that it doesnt take sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell when someone is cured of one the nlp phobia cure is simple visualization which requires less than minutes nlpers claim thatit can also be used to neutralize traumatic memory and hence isuseful in treating post traumatic

incident theprocess doesnt need to be repeated and the subject doesnt need topractice it over again at home now to me it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure especially if as nlpers claim the success rate is extremely high take someone with fear of heights as used to have take them up to balcony on the th floor and observe their response spend minutes to have them do the simple visualization send them back up to the balcony and see if things have changed check back with them in few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting more long term follow up is certainly desirable but from scientific point of view even cure that lasts several weeks has significance in any case there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years to the best of my knowledge there is no known case where the cure has been reversed after holding for few weeks my own cure incidentally was donewith slightly different nlp technique before learned of the fast phobia trauma cure ten years later now enjoy living on the thfloor of my building and having large balcony the folks over in sci psychology have hundred and one excuses not tomake this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome studywill be satisfactory study of the sort that nlp practitioners many of whom make barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous and since theyre not part of thescientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance the fast phobia trauma cure is over ten years old now and the clinical psychology establishment is still saying we dont have any way of knowing that its effective these academics themselves have the resources to do study as elaborate as anyone could want of course but they say why should prove your theory and the burden of proof is on the one making the claim one academic in sci psychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasnt been described in scientific journal its described in number of books and ive posted articles in sci psychology describing it in as much detail as im capable of actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done with favorable results but its apparently not acceptable because its adoctoral dissertation and not published in refereed journal to me this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it this is the kind of thing have in mind when talk about doctrinnaire attitudes about science now maybe have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you russell if so apologize in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like science than collection of competing

order to go to baku when we left everything in town was fine life was the same as usual few groups of people were discussing things soccer and other things then we got on the sumgait bus bound for baku for my first cousins birthday my father my mother and we spent the day in baku and on the th somewhere around we got on the bus for home figuring that id have enough time to do my homework for the next day when we were entering town near the story high rises our bus was stopped by very large crowd the crowd demanded that the armenians get off the bus the driver says that there are no armenians on board then everyone on the busbegins to shout that there are no armenians on board the group comes up to the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one not checking passports just going by the way people look we get off the bus but are not taken for armenians we set out in the direction of home at first we were going to go into an old building where we knew thered be place to hide but the whole road was packed with groups of people all the way from block to the th microdistrict these groups were emptying peoples pockets and people who didnt have passports with them were beaten as well then we decided to go home instead near the story high rises saw burningcars and great many people standing around the driveways yelling death tothe armenians was written on the cars when we came into the courtyard we live in an shaped building it was stillquiet we went on upstairs but didnt turn on any lights we tried to call baku to warn our relatives who were due to arrive on wednesday not to come then there was knock at the door it was our neighbors who advised us to come down to stay at their place we went down to their place and they led usto the basement they live on the first floor and have basement which you enter across the balcony we sat in the basement while an armenian woman was beaten she ran away naked our neighbors daughter said that thats right thats what the armenians deserve because in stepanakert allegedly people were being killed girls from agdam had been raped we didnt stay very long in the basement we tried to support one another as best we could looking out the small window with the iron grating papa watched and said things now and then he said that there was fire near building probably acar on fire then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that they be shown the apartments where armenians lived the neighbors said that there werent any armenians here and the group set out for the other wing of the building they appeared from the side of the building where later found out woman had been murdered the woman who ran away naked died yuriavakian was killed too when the crowd left the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go home we went back up to our place and again didnt turn on the light we started to gather up our things in order to leave sumgait for while wetried to call relative who lived in sumgait but there was no answer wedecided she had already left we sat at home the phone rang and the caller asked to speak with myfather called him to the phone it was jeykhun mamedov from my fatherswork brigade he said he was disgusted by what was happening in ourtown he asked for our address and promised to get car and help us getout of the city to be quite honest papa didnt want to give him our address but my mother got on the phone and told him some minutes after thecall crowd ran into our entryway bursting into the building they brokedown the door and came into the apartment they came straight to our apartment they knew exactly where the armenians were they came into our place we tried to resist but there was nothing we could do one of them took my parents passports and began to read them he read the surname danielian turned the page read armenian and that alonewas enough to doom us he said that we should be moved quickly out into the courtyard where they would have done with us another standing next to him pushed some of the keys on the piano and said your death has tolled they had knives and steel truncheons had knife in my hand unfortunately didnt use it just knew that ifi didnt give up the knife things would be much worse they struck my parents and said that should put the knife on the piano then one of them commandedthat we be taken outside one person was giving orders when we were taken outdoors went in the middle and my mother was behind me someone started topush her so shed walk faster let her go ahead of me and fell in behind her when he tried to push me hit him and at that moment they began beating my parents realized that resistance was completely useless we are taken out into the courtyard and the neighbors are standing on their balconies to see what will happen next the crowd surrounds us at first they strike me and im knocked out when come to they beat me again lose consciousness often dont see or hear my parents since was thefirst one hit and was out cold when come to try to pick them up they arelying next to me the crowd is gone the only people around are watching from their balconies thats it try to pick them up but cant my left arm is broken start toward the drive wanting to tell the neighbors to call an ambulance the bodies of my parents are still warm we were attacked at around oclock regain consciousness at about and try to make it up the stairs home when knock at the neighbors door they push me back and tell me to go away go up to the third floor our neighbor puts damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance shesends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment often look out the window to see if the ambulance has arrived but cant see very far as result of the blows and it seems that my parents have already been taken away then calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken away and everything will be ok but they were still there later at in the morning as found out

repelled no revolted to hear the baku announcer who read the decisionof the azerbaijani supreme soviet presidium against karabagh becoming part of armenia after the events in sumgait and those in baku

talk politics misc ,organization mit artificial intelligence lablines nntp posting host life ai mit edu the white house office of the press immediate release april press briefing by george stephanopoulos the briefing room edt mr stephanopoulos guess im just prepared to take questions today george bob dole says that the clinton administrations policy on bosnia is failure and that he wants the united states to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that the bosnian muslims can defend themselves mr stephanopoulos as you know president clinton has said that that suggestion is under active consideration obviously this is tragic situation in bosnia and if the bosnian serbs dont come to the negotiating table in constructive way well look seriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo in the meantime were going to continue to press for tough sanctions resolution in the were going to continue to work on the serbs to come to the negotiating table but the prospect of an arms embargo is something the president certainly will consider if the serbs dont come to the table how much longer are you going to give them to come to the table george mr stephanopoulos were working on that right now its been long time on february th the president mentioned the value added tax in ohio and when he was asked about it later by reporters he said quote that is radical change in the tax system of the united states its something think we may have to look at in the years ahead questioned again about it later he says it is not something that is now under consideration if we start considering it ill tell you it wasnt trial balloon or anything he said was just discussing the tax response to question donna shalala quoted in usa today this morning quote certainly were looking at vat whats gone on the same with alice rivlin this morning mr stephanopoulos the health care task force is reviewing number of options they havent made any decisions yet and as have said from this podium time and time again were not going to comment on decisions that havent been made but you have also said from this podium time and time again wait minute whoa nelly whoa that that was not under consideration yes clinton says it is not something that is now under consideration is that no longer true mr stephanopoulos believe the working group as ms shalala says has looked at this prospect but no decisions have been made of any kind well know but he said hed tell us about it if it was ever under consideration take it that now he is and he didnt tell us about it or mr stephanopoulos did he say if it was under consideration or if it was something to be proposed if we start considering ill tell you mr stephanopoulos if its something to be proposed if we start considering it ill tell you thats direct quote mr stephanopoulos the task force has looked at number of different options they have not made any decisions yet the president has not made any decisions yet this is one of the proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and cast as wide net as possible for different ideas on how to reform the health care system they have cast very wide net they have looked at hundreds of different proposals probably thousands of different proposals but the president has not made any decisions well is the president aware of their consideration of this option mr stephanopoulos dont know if hes been briefed on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task force on this specific proposal of any kind dont know that thats gotten to his level he started yesterday to go through with the task force very wide range of decisions and dont believe that thats been presented to him no well hes not relying on the usa today to tell him what his task force is considering in the way of taxes mr stephanopoulos no hes going through it in very deliberate fashion there are number of decisions that have to be made dont know that this proposal has reached that decision making point if this is still under consideration thats change at least from what weve been told by dee dee think about three weeks ago or so she said that is not an option talking about the had big argument with somebody over this so remember it specifically and said it not once but twice is that not the case mr stephanopoulos again dont know if this has been presented to the president as something that is being looked at at some level in the task force it was ruled it out though mean unlike other options that youve kept in the mix this one specifically was ruled out mr stephanopoulos again this is something that is being looked at but no decision has been made of any kind mean it doesnt its not necessarily material until you get to the decision making phase the working groups are looking at hundreds of different options if it was ruled out before and its not ruled out now then something has changed george yes no when guy says in february mr stephanopoulos well the working groups are looking at the widest possible range of options so somethings changed they werent looking at it before theyre looking at it now mr stephanopoulos well dont know if the working groups have gotten to that point yet they are casting very wide net how was it possible that you and dee dee were able to sell definitively rule it out as an option previously and now are saying that in fact it is being considered mr stephanopoulos again the working groups are looking at wide range of options they have not do you deny that you and dee dee ruled it flatly ruled it out on several occasions in the past month mr stephanopoulos dont deny that mean those are the presidents words those are very clear subsequent to the presidents words do you deny that within the last month you and dee dee have both publicly ruled it out mr stephanopoulos dont know about the timing think what we did was refer back to the presidents words and say they stand so dont they stand any longer march th clinton said for the next four to five years it was ruled out mr stephanopoulos well those words the president did say that in february the working groups are on separate track and as said dont believe separate from the president mr stephanopoulos dont believe this has been presented to the president are they considering something that the president has ruled out has ruled out mean will the president consider vat tax mr stephanopoulos again the working groups have not presented this to the president they have looked at wide range of options suppose that if an argument is made he will clearly listen to it that does not mean he has decided to do it can we put this another way in his answer in ohio he looked at the vat in terms of restructuring the whole tax system under those that was the circumstance that he said it might be considered at some future point is that no longer the case or is that the only way that he can see vat emerging mr stephanopoulos guess im not sure exactly what youre asking he talked about the vat in the context of restructured tax system not as specific way to finance health care for example or anything else or anything else it was always in the context of substituting for other taxes at time of dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system mr stephanopoulos right has that change too is that still his view mr stephanopoulos havent spoken about those specific comments think can just go back to it are the working groups have they examined the possibility of vat yes they have certainly were looking at vat she said mr stephanopoulos they have examined the possibility of vat has it been presented to the president has he made decision no he has not what kind of deal do you have when youve got the presidents appointed task force obviously not oblivious to his ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line reform goes ahead on its own and considers tax which he has specifically ruled out in any context other than much later and then goes ahead and announces that thats what theyre looking at is the president concerned about that sort of thing mr stephanopoulos think that the presidents concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal possible hes concerned with making sure that they have the most thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives all the different alternatives if decision is made to go forward with something like that its certainly something the president will explain and justify but no decision has been made along those lines what does it mean exactly though when the president rules something out does it mean it can get back on the table later if more persuasive argument is made mr stephanopoulos thats just thats indisputably true if you but at the same time he has not ruled it in he has not made proposal what makes him open to it now when he wasnt open to it before mr stephanopoulos hes certainly willing to listen to the argument was he willing to listen to the argument for short term tax this year and he wasnt willing to listen to it in chilicothe hes now open to it mr stephanopoulos the context of his comments was that it was not something he wanted to be clear that this is not something he was proposing not something he was floating not something he was considering those are his words its not something thats now under consideration if we start considering it ill tell you youre now acknowledging are you not that it is under consideration and mr stephanopoulos im acknowledging that the task force has studied this proposal am also stating that the president has not made decision on it but the door is open for the president to reconsider including this as part of mr stephanopoulos obviously the working groups are looking at it again but the president has not made decision do you know if they will make presentation on behalf of the vat to him mr stephanopoulos dont know that assume that if dont know what stage they are it in proposing dont know that theyre going to make the conclusion that this is something they should present to him know this is something the working groups are looking at do you understand george that none of us are asking these questions in context of decision that the president has made only about what the president is considering mr stephanopoulos understand that and am acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of vat and the president will consider it mr stephanopoulos assume that he will consider the argument if it is presented to him does that mean the president that working groups think that when the president says no he means maybe laughter mr stephanopoulos think that means that the working groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible george can ask you another question about bosnia mr stephanopoulos sure laughter no he wants us to stay on this lets do gays in the military laughter no he got out of that swamp think weve gotten the bottom line on that vat reggie bartholomew your special ambassador in belgrade today said that if the serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked out quote we will do our part to pursue the lifting of the arms embargo together with our allies that seems to go bit further than what youve just said mr stephanopoulos sounds almost exactly what just said well do you accept in other words you accept what reggie mr stephanopoulos well the president has said that this is something thats under consideration it is something he will consider if the current actions dont bring the serbs to the table isnt there some kind of timetable here mr stephanopoulos yes there is timetable theres going to be vote on the resolution in about days thats on sanctions thats on tightening the sanctions mr stephanopoulos thats right thats sanctions and we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure and we hope that that will bring the serbs to the table as you know mr bartholomew also met with mr churkin of russia and they are also working on ways to bring the serbs to the table we will continue to pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option as well the question is whether theres timetable for consideration or vote on decision on lifting the arms embargo not the sanctions mr stephanopoulos the next vote in the is on sanctions as far as know there are no votes scheduled on lifting the arms embargo but it is something that we have discussed both internally and with our allies why did reggie bartholomew tell the serbs that the would do that what was the point of his telling them that mr stephanopoulos well clearly mean this is something thats under consideration and this is something that we take quite seriously if they do not come to the table they should know the consequences of failing to come to the table have they been given deadline warren christopher has been saying the same thing and it hasnt seemed to change the serbs behavior in the least why should the serbs take any heed of threat to lift the arms embargo when so far everything thats been done has had no effect on the fighting in bosnia mr stephanopoulos just dont accept the premise of your question it has had an effect the embargo is having an effect what effect mr stephanopoulos if the serbians choose not to heed our warnings then they will face the consequences what effect has it had in bosnia mr stephanopoulos well the effect that it has had on the serbians it has tightened up they are not getting their shipments through we can brief more fully in bosnia george in bosnia what effect has it had mr stephanopoulos well its hard to say if its stopped the aggression to date that is why were continuing to press for the serbians to stop but we believe that over time we will continue to weaken the serbs and that will have an effect im not saying its going to happen overnight it clearly hasnt happened overnight but we believe that over time the sanctions can weaken the serbs if it fails to work and if the serbs fail to come to the negotiating table well move forward with the embargo isnt there working deadline george of the th the same date as the the scheduled vote hasnt the united states said along with many of the other nato allies that if the serbs arent willing to sign on to the peace accord by then that well seek havent we said that we will seek mr stephanopoulos weve said continually were going to but on that deadline mr stephanopoulos dont have specific date but were going to move forward with the resolution the resolution by around that time and if that fails to take effect if that fails to bring the serbs to the table we will clearly consider other actions isnt this awfully incremental mr stephanopoulos were taking step by step approach were ratcheting up the pressure and were going to continue to do that is there possibility george that by the time all these incremental steps are taken the serbs will have achieved their goals and then whats the purpose mr stephanopoulos think the purpose is to get the serbs to stop the aggression we are pursuing that goal on many different fronts we are pursuing it through the were pursuing it through direct talks we are pursuing it through tightening the sanctions and we will consider lifting the arms embargo we are turning the screws up on the serbs and we will continue to do that but if the efforts have been unsuccessful in getting the serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any campaign be to have the serbs give back what theyve gained mean once theyre entrenched mr stephanopoulos cant speculate on that were going to continue to press for them to come to the table now were going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression but cant see into the future george on the stimulus package house republicans say theyre going to hold series of town meetings on saturday to try and explain the details of your package they cite polls which show that the more people learn about it the less they like it whats your strategy to counter that mr stephanopoulos the strategy we have is the one were going to continue as you saw the president today pointed up the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package will provide new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner cities and suburbs to do productive work we are also going to point out the benefits of the highway money the investments in highways were going to point up the benefits of immunization were going to point up the benefits of head start we are going to say that the republicans have choice they can take action to create jobs or they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years does it concern you though that the house now the house republicans are after you as well as the senate mr stephanopoulos the house republicans voted against it before they made mistake then theyre making mistake now george does it strike anybody in the administration that its bit strong to describe as the president did this morning the summer jobs program as quote reaffirmation of promise of america mr stephanopoulos not at all think its the promise of america to give kids chance to reach their full potential government funded jobs mr stephanopoulos to give people chance to work absolutely that is the promise of america want to follow up on something asked yesterday where does summer jobs where does that figure come from mr stephanopoulos that is on top of did look at it there are currently summer jobs in the pipeline this will be on top of the so it will be total of million the would be created by the stimulus package mr stephanopoulos yes where does that number come from because weve been told all along that the stimulus package would create new jobs and according to panetta that breaks down to something like full time jobs and summer jobs mr stephanopoulos yes but the summer thats when you do their full time equivalence mean individuals will receive jobs this summer when you calculate it for the full time job effect you have to do dont know what the exact formula is seven hundred thousand part time jobs mr stephanopoulos or one to four because its three months mr stephanopoulos thank you can follow up on that did the president misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money for these summer jobs will pay for private for kids to work in the private sector mr stephanopoulos not necessarily mean think that there will be grants available thats one of the ways that you pay for the jobs at the same time hes also issued challenge to the private sector to hire kids on their own as well tax dollars for instance would pay for kids to work at time warner mr stephanopoulos think the time warner is actually somebody coming forward and actually doing grant thats going to be the bulk of it there could be isolated instances though where there would be grants to businesses has the president spoken with any senate republicans this week mr stephanopoulos no but theres been lot of contact with senate republicans in the white house at lower level but the president hasnt mr stephanopoulos the president has not no getting any closer to get the votes mr stephanopoulos were continuing to work on it anybody leaning your way on haiti the new york times seems to be reporting something of breakthrough in aristides attitude towards the coup leaders can you confirm that there has been this change and what impact will it have on the process and what did pezzullo have to say yesterday in his report mr stephanopoulos pezzullo did brief the principals cant confirm whats actually happening in the talks would leave that to the negotiators themselves but mr caputo has returned to haiti we have received briefing here at the white house from ambassador pezzullo and as we have said time and time again we believe that assurances of security are important to final resolution to broader political settlement george yesterday you offered some selective breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities can we get complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be impacted mr stephanopoulos think we have it for most states yes and think we can get it out could you make that generally available mr stephanopoulos believe we can and could you do it by the component of the stimulus in other words mr stephanopoulos dont know if we can do know that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs dont know how deeply it can be broken down but clearly we can break it down into summer jobs and other jobs and can follow up is this the information that jeff eller and the rest of the white house is using in the ads in the states mr stephanopoulos dont know if theyre ads but theyre press releases can you describe what those press releases contain mr stephanopoulos all were doing is pointing out the benefits of this package to various states for instance know that today senator dole is heading up to vermont and new hampshire and would point out that the stimulus package the jobs package creates jobs in vermont it creates jobs in new hampshire and the people of those states should remind him that this is important where are the releases going mr stephanopoulos they go to the states to whom mr stephanopoulos we can get them its no problem can we get it why dont you put them out here as well mr stephanopoulos think we can this afternoon would that be possible mr stephanopoulos ill have to check dont know but as soon as we can are you focusing these press releases on states where there are moderate or pragmatic republican senators mr stephanopoulos think were trying to get as many as we can its actually quite difficult to pull this together and were doing our best were putting them out as we get them why are you so closely tracking senator doles schedule mr stephanopoulos was just following it are press releases going along to states where hes visiting mr stephanopoulos im not sure think that probably there are press releases going to vermont laughter will there be man in chicken suit waiting laughter george as the president goes about the business of defending whats in his stimulus package he doesnt address what seems to be the republicans main point that youre funding it with deficit spending rather than if its so important why not come up with the funding for it seems to be the republican argument and how do you answer that mr stephanopoulos what was answer is we are paying for it over time and if you look at our budget we pay for this package over time we believe right now the economy needs jump start for jobs youre not claiming are you that that doesnt add to the deficit this year mr stephanopoulos im saying were paying for it over time didnt say that know that george but mean from the beginning the question we do have annual budgets and things deficit spending will pay for that this year will it not mr stephanopoulos this year they clearly will but over time our budget fully pays for this program what youre saying is that there are savings that would cover this if it were this year in future years mr stephanopoulos absolutely thats exactly what said know that but there is going to be outstanding debt it will add to the national debt from this year mr stephanopoulos no were reducing the deficit by billion billion over the next four years you mean youre reducing it below what it would have been mr stephanopoulos exactly in fact youre adding very large amount to the national debt over the period of mr stephanopoulos but were reducing it far more from what it would have been thats true washington type reduction laughter youre getting to be grumpy old man george has any decision been made about the white house or the presidents participation in the gay rights march coming up in week and half mr stephanopoulos were working on the presidents schedule now believe hes going to be at the senate democratic retreat in jamestown that weekend will he address it by phone mr stephanopoulos dont know about that its little far out but believe hes going to be in the senate retreat so will he have the leaders in day or two before the speech mr stephanopoulos dont know would expect that at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups dont know the schedule on it though will there be an aids czar appointed prior to or in conjunction with the event mr stephanopoulos im just not sure april nd is earth day what is the president going to do to mark that and is it the case that he is going to sign the biodiversity treaty that day mr stephanopoulos know theres been some work on the biodiversity treaty dont know about signing it that day but would expect hell have statement on earth day or right around then where is the work on the biodiversity treaty mr stephanopoulos id have to check with katie mcginty just know that theres been some work done but dont know exactly what when is earth day mr stephanopoulos the nd think why is it you know that he is going to have statement on earth day but you dont know if hes going to have statement on the gay rights march mr stephanopoulos said dont know if hes going to meet or when hes going to meet do you have statement on the gay rights march mr stephanopoulos dont actually no wouldnt be surprised if he did though do you have some details on the miyazawa visit mr stephanopoulos its working visit on friday and the president is looking forward to that in discussing number of issues including russian aid and the japanese stimulus package and the trade issues between the two countries there was some expectations that second aid package to russia was going to be unveiled at the meeting and if understand it hasnt happened why is that or whats the status on that mr stephanopoulos the meeting is still going on and as you know secretaries bentsen and christopher have talked about the outlines of possible package but were going to continue to consult with congress and our allies on that we will not then make any kind of announcement during the two day meeting mr stephanopoulos the meetings not over yet is that when youre going to make one mr stephanopoulos im not ruling out the possibility the presidents going to announce it tomorrow bentsen said that yes bentsen said it would be tomorrow so did christopher mr stephanopoulos id have to look at that but believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of tokyo george has there been further consideration here about going to sending the president out to los angeles mr stephanopoulos dont know that theres its not something weve ruled out we dont have date set for it george you all have position or do you support immigrations plan to settle iraqi prisoners in the united states mr stephanopoulos its the first ive heard of it george there was report today about the fortunately laughter about the pace of appointments and says that president clinton is behind president bush in the number of positions that people have been nominated for are you going to speed up the pace of nominations or where do you stand with it mr stephanopoulos we filled of the presidents appointments and its broken down we have schedule noncareer ses pas full time im not sure what that means laughter pa full time and this is about the same its about the same pace of president bush obviously as you move along farther once you each level of appointment actually has multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments so we expect the process to speed up but were at the pace of bush obviously wed like to get these done as quickly as possible would point out that the fbi background checks and the background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time than our predecessors and that is part of the holdup but were working on it is that because of nannygate mr stephanopoulos think thats an awful big part of it yes in the story this morning you were at approximately the same pace as bush in making appointments but way behind in winning confirmations mr stephanopoulos thats where the background checks comes into play thats the problem thats the background checks problem because mean you have democratic senate mr stephanopoulos no thats not the you make the appointments and then it takes quite bit of time to fill out all the forms and have the background checks done thats exactly where the problem is whats the president doing this afternoon and whats on the plan for tomorrow mr stephanopoulos hes got some meetings just office meetings this afternoon for the most part on variety of issues that probably half dozen different issues and then hell be tomorrow well have an event probably again focused on the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the white house and friday is the miyazawa meeting will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow george mr stephanopoulos either tomorrow or friday is there going to be pre briefing regarding the japanese prime ministers visit tomorrow mr stephanopoulos dont know about tomorrow but well probably get something done as we usually do for these visits was reverend jackson here this morning and do you know what that was about mr stephanopoulos he was here he met with group of us here at the white house including mack mclarty who reverend jackson mr stephanopoulos reverend jackson mack mclarty me gene sperling bruce reed jeff watson mark gearan talking about haiti mr stephanopoulos we talked about general urban policy he is about to go to los angeles he was just back from mississippi where we had good victory last night and hes going on to los angeles did he request the meeting mr stephanopoulos actually no hes in continual contact with the president he had written letter on variety of issues and so we asked him to come in and talk about it george dole is having fundraiser for jeffords tonight in vermont have you guys been in contact with jeffords at all on this mr stephanopoulos think theres been some contact sure can you tell us about the contacts mr stephanopoulos im not sure do you know who contacted him or what was said mr stephanopoulos know that howard paster talked to him and they just has general talk about the package and did he express his support for it now or is he mr stephanopoulos cant divulge the details of the conversation but there have been conversations the times is reporting that abortion elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care package is this something the president is considering mr stephanopoulos again along with the vat laughter mr stephanopoulos its certainly something thats been looked at but no decisions have been made what was the question mr stephanopoulos the times story on whether abortions will be covered by the presidents health plan did the president in his meeting did you in your meeting with reverend jackson ask his advice solicit his advice about what kind of stance the white house should take in the wake of the verdict in mr stephanopoulos well we certainly talked about the situation in los angeles and the long term prospects for

soc religion christian ,organization university of southern california los angeles calines few points about marys being taken into heaven at the end of her life onearth one piece of evidence for marys assumption into heaven is the factthat no christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she wasburied some christian churches claimed to be located at the finalresting places of peter mark and other saints but no one everclaimed to possess the body of mary the greatest of the saints why because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption ofmary some passages seem suggestive like the passage in revelationthat describes woman giving birth to son and later being crownedin the heavens of course the woman in this passage has she can also be taken symbol for the church the assumption of mary makes sense because of her relationship tochrist jesus perfect god and perfect man fulfilled therequirements of the law perfectly under the law god gave to us weare to honor our mother and father and christs act of taking hismother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law also hetook his flesh from her so it seems appropriate that he decide not toallow her flesh to rot in the grave one last point an ex catholic attempted to explain catholic doctrineon the assumption by asserting it is connected to belief that marydid not die this is not correct summary of what catholics believe the dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid sayingwhether mary did or did not die in fact the consensus among seems to be that mary in fact did die this would makesense christ died and his mother who waited at the foot of thecross would want to share in his death brian finnerty

trash togerard for gerard to examine gerard would later return the trash tobullock from wide range of sources bullock compiled files on individuals and more than political groups gerard whose filescontained many identical entries kept files on people in bullock and gerard began selling some of their vast wealth ofinformation to the south african government bullock tells ofmeetings secretly with south african agents at san francisco hotelsand receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new bills bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culledonly from public sources once he rewrote an innocuous item publishedby san francisco chronicle columnist herb caen about south africanbishop desmond tutu and the wife of prominent attorney melvin belli and submitted it as his own work bullock said it was gerard who sold official police intelligence bullock said he split about from the south african with gerard telling him at one point may be gay but im

police department on various nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed underdepartment policy bullock said he also received confidential fbi report on the nationof islam that he later shredded at

in the bigs especially when they havent even played aaa ball we certainly believe this kid is going to be very good some day but there is really no need to rush him especially since we have mega million dollar staff that is probably well served by battery mate who is expereienced in game calling and pitcher handling lopez time will come lets give him some time in aaa javy lopez has proven over ab in the minor leagues that he isready to play in the majors he is not being rushed players who areclearly too good for aa and play behind stiffs at the major league levelare wasting their time and may actually have court case againstmajor league management for keeping them at aaa no maybe need to improve my writing skills lopez who is very ordinary defensively is not likely to hit so well at age unless lopez is me defensively im and born to playsecond base he belongs in the major leagues training what does he have to do to earn chance maybe not full time job but at least couple starts and few ab for him to prove his worth gee dont know abs sounds pretty good to me about as good as your reasoning that the kid should play back up role rather than start every day at aaa talk about me as gm valentine isnt saying he should back up hes saying he should be putin position to win the job in the major leagues which imho hewould if given the opportunity val if im misinterpreting pleaselet me know so far you have come up with two arguments against lopez he is very ordinary defensively he is young and most players suck when they are young the first is irrelevant hes trying to make the majors with his bat and the second involves seriously warped reasoning valentine ok most players are not ready for the bigs at age see current related posting on clayton one of my favorites most players benefit rather than being stagnant or hurt by playing at aaa most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs those are the arguments against lopez for the braves for this year but the players who are ready are the best and the ones mostlikely to benefit from being in the majors javy lopez is not middle of the road prospect hes the real thing now again the most important thing player can do is hit lopez does thatmiles better than olson or berryhill if his defense is good enough forgreenville or richmond its good enough for atlanta if he really wasawful defensively he would no longer be catcher see sprague ed now the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out runners not superstars mind you but solid experienced veterans the braves have very solid lineup with two big bats in the outfield an excellent platoon at first solid mvp candidate at third and one of the better hitting shortstops the center field platoon will probably hit however good lopez what they have to offset the differential in experience and defensive ability the kid will improve playing at aaa and he probably wont being reserve with the big club oh where to start ok first of all solid good want good players solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who reallyarent very good at baseball think of it as twg without the caps its losing strategy to say we have solid guys we dont need to improve you used it four times in that paragraph btw same for experienced might add though that greg olson and damonberryhill arent exactly carter and fisk olson has played three years berryhill five although and were wash the only difference imho between olson and valle is the supporting cast two big bats hrm like justice but find mr gants trend disturbing call it one and maybe the braves platoon is ok but neither playerhas any value outside of the platoon bream vs lh and hunter vs rhare awful ill leave the thirdbase comment alone pendleton has wastedtoo much bandwidth already if the cf platoon hits ill retracemr likhanis midnight run down forbes and live in ny and la got that mike and doesnt cox call pitches anyway goodness do you believe the other poster who thinks lopez is being held down because of his future earning potential why on earth do you people thinkthe braves made this decision are they idiots who have built this ballclub jeeeesh nope theyre baseball management possible the most short sighted collection of people in the nation do you not

the followups to this but thought id go back to the original article to make specific comments about the method jao megatest com john oswalt said he has obtained the play by play records in computer readable form for every major league baseball game for the past several years he devised an algorithm which call sum over situations and wrote computer program to calculate every major league players contribution using it it works like this look at every situation in every game in baseball season situation is determined by inning score where the baserunners are and how many outs there are for each situation count how many times the team eventually won the game that the situation occured in and divide by the number of times the situation came up to come up with value for that situation this was first done by george lindsey in the late early and reported in article an investigation of strategies in baseball author george lindsey journal operations research issue volume july august pp later pete palmer did the same thing using simulated seasons to generate larger set of data to avoid the kind of small sample anomalies that other people have worried about he reported this in with john thorn gary skoog modified the method bit and did some work on what he called value added measure based on these situational values his were based directly on marginal runs though not on win probabilities these results as applied to the season were reported in one of the bill james baseball abstract books help me out here somebody for example situation might be inning score runner on second and no outs there were regular season major league games last year with the rockies and marlins there will be more this year say this situation came up in of those and the team ahead won of them then the value of this situation is description of method look at change in win probability based on the at bat plus any baserunning and credit debit the player by that amount each time he gets plate appearance now for each player sum up all his at bat and base running values for the season to obtain an overall value for that player obviously the sum of all players values for each game and for the season as whole will be thats only because you always credit to the batter and to the pitcher theres no validation involved ok theres very big problem here that nobody has yet commented on youre adding probabilities and probabilities dont add runs you can add the total team runs breaks down into how many runs joe contributed plus how many runs fred contributed etc but probabilities dont work that way if bob increases his teams chance of winning by in each of pas that does not mean that bob increased his teams chance of winning by in fact it doesnt mean anything because the units are screwy agree and disagree john is saying that the batters efforts will resultin more wins then losses while you are probably correct that does not mean more wins then losses it means something wouldrather have player who increased my teams chances of winning by ineach of pas then would player who increased my chances of winningby in each of pas thus there appears to me to be an obviouspositive association between johns statistic and winning games thus before you disregard this stat it appears to me that further study mustgo into what sort of relationship there is consider an example bob hits out solo hr in the bottom of the first about on your scale he does the same thing again in the fourth with the score tied for another and again in the seventh with the score tied for another and finally in the ninth to win the game by score of for value of bob hit solo hr in plate appearances and was credited by your method with but what does that mean was bob responsible for the win certainly not the defense is always responsible if you include pitching in that and bob wasnt pitching in fact bob was only of the offense which is lot but not even close to furthermore what about the other team runs say they all came on solo hr by fred then fred was hitting hr to tie up the game which are just as valuable as hr to take the lead see lindsey and fred will himself have accrued good rating or so so fred and bob combined have amassed of win in one game theres clearly problem here the only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactlyhow many wins the team has first we are using averages over manyseasons and applying them to one game second remember some take away from the chance of you winning that is aplayer who gets an out gets negative probability in most cases thus im not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbersfor team who won that they will add up to in that game sometimes they will add up to more then one sometime less than one also the pitchers bad performances giving up runs may have giventhem large negative percentage for that game also any batter thatpulled an night would give large negatives greg thinking about the right things but his intuition is off the mark closers are enormously important the total number of runs value is outweighed by when they come or are prevented from comming the doubling which greg allows is not enough in another article proposed test of this we can predict teams won lost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs total they score and allow without regard to when those runs score in the game if late runs are really more important than early runs then looking only at late runs should lead to better predictor right no but really only because you have smaller sample size wouldthink however that the number of runs you score in the first inningwould be just as good as prediction as how many runs you score in the last inning and realize something else closer usuallycomes in in close situation not blow out it is hard to arguethat any runs that closer gives up in game have equal importanceto those given up in the first inning look closer giving up runsoften means team will lose many games on the other hand starterwho gives up runs often still leaves his team chance to win theoffence has many more outs to do something about but am notsaying all late inning situations are equally important either ifi am down runs in the ninth it really does not matter how manyruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth heres another thought experiment apply this method to basketball what you find is that points scored in the first half of the game have almost exactly no value because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play furthermore the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with no time on the clock gets for the game while the star forward who scored points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets zero does this make sense no but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning wouldbe before the possesion in which the free throws were made look if you are down point with seconds left there is fairly highprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of theball and do not forget that somebody elses missed shots turnovers fouls bad defense etc caused negative chance that the teamwould win from reading all of the discussion on this statistic feel that thosewho critisize it to certain extent are doing so out of an agenda at first look this statistic valadates clutchness but it reallydoes not cluthness revolves around the idea that certain playersin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performancegoes down ive never seen convincing proof that this really happens so if you assume there is no clutchness then that means that exceptfor lot of noice this statistic has positive association toplayer performance there is way to get rid of the noice if youdo not believe in clutchness certainly we could find out whatthe average value of home run is for example we may find forinstance that home run increases your chance of winning by on average while strikeout decreases your chance of winning by bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was justas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses how do we evaluate relief pitchers say john and sam have theexact same pitching statistics runs earned runs ks bbs etc both had exceptional numbers john however only pitchedin closer situations while sam was mop up man who was morevaluble to their team probably john who was the better pitcher they were probably about the same brian smith

operators do with anonymous postings what is going on with anon penet fi maintained by helsingius identity what is identity on the internet generally today peoples identity on the internet is primarily determined by their email address in the sense that this is their most unchanging face in the electronic realm this is your login name qualified by the complete address domain information for example ld longs lance colostate edu people see this address when receiving mail or reading usenet posts from you and in other situations where programs record usage some obsolete forms of addresses such as bitnet still persist in email messages additional information on the path that message takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient this information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the transmission and is very accurate trace of its origination this type of identify and forward protocol is also used in the usenet protocol to lesser extent forging these fields requires corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and is very uncommon not so uncommon is forging the chain at the origination point so that all initial sites in the list are faked at the time the message is created tracing these messages can be difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of real machines and represent real transfer routes why is identity un important on the internet the concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication privacy and security which in turn are all critical aspects of computer networks for example the convenience of communication afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for identification but there are many potential abuses of identity possible that can have very severe consequences with massive computer networks at the forefront of the issue which can potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems verifying that an identity is correct is called authentication and one classic example of the problems associated with it is wells war of the worlds radio broadcast that fooled segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was in progress hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on usenet and forged identities makes them more insidious people and their reputations can be assaulted by forgery however the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of its most attractive features identity is just as useful as it is harmful professor might carefully explain topic until he finds he is talking to an undergraduate person of particular occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally shun him some prejudices are erased but on the other hand many prejudices are useful scientist might argue he can better evaluate the findings of paper as reviewer if he knows more about the authors likewise he may be more likely to reject it based on unfair or irrelevant criteria on the other side of the connection the author may find identities of reviewers useful in exerting pressure for acceptance identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating credit not necessarily financial and ownership and usage many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques for identification heavy reliance will be placed on digital authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic many government functions and services are based on identification and law enforcement frequently hinges on it hence employees of many government organizations push toward stronger identification structures but when does identification invade privacy the growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive proportions decisions made now on issues of identity will affect many future users especially as the network becomes increasingly global universal widespread and entrenched and the positive or adverse affects of these actions intended and inadvertent will literally be magnified exponentially how does my email address not identify me and my background your email address may contain information that influences peoples perceptions of your background the address may identify you as from department at particular university an employee at company or government worker it may contain your last name initials or cryptic identification codes independent of both in the us some are based on parts of social security numbers others are in the form where the number is incremented in the order that new users are added to the system standard internet addresses also can contain information on your broad geographical location or nationhood however none of this information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all the fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on rather arbitrary organization such as mostly invisible network cabling distributions the only point to make is that early fields in the address are more specific such as specific computer names or local networks and the later ones the most general such as continental domains typically the first field is the name of the computer receiving mail gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise for more information see the faqs on email addresses and known geographical distributions below however unix utilities exist to aid in the quest see the question on this common suffixes us united states uk united kingdom ca canada fi finland au australia edu university or college com commercial organization org other nonprofit organization gov government mil military site how can find out more about somebody with given email address one simple way is to send email to that address asking another way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address postmaster address although the postmasters job is more to help find user ids of particular people given their real name and solve mail routing problems the sysadmin root address may also be able to supply information users with related email address may have information however all of these methods rely on the time and patience of others so use them minimally one of the most basic tools for determining identity over the internet is the unix utility finger the basic syntax is finger user here there everywhere this utility uses communication protocols to query the computer named in the address for information on the user named the response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may be in any format possible responses are as follows message unknown host meaning some aspect of the address is incorrect two lines with no information and message in real life in which case the receiving computer could not find any kind of match on the username the finger utility may return this response in other situations listing of information associated with multiple users some computers will search only for matching user ids others will attempt to find the username you specified as substring of all actual full names of users kept in local database at some sites finger can be used to get list of all users on the system with finger address in general this is often considered weak security however because attackers know valid user ids to crack passwords more information on the fields returned by finger is given below more information on finger and locating peoples email addresses is given in the email faq such as the whois lookup utility just as you can use these means to find out about others they can use them to find out about you you can finger yourself to find out what is publicly reported by your unix system about you be careful when modifying finger data virtually anyone with internet access worldwide can query this information in one amazing case the new york times writer markoff uncovered the identity of morris author of the internet worm through the use of an anonymous tip and finger see the book cyberspace by hafner and markoff why is identification un stable on the internet generally identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept on the internet for variety of reasons one is the inherent fluidity of cyberspace where people emerge and submerge frequently and absences are not readily noted in the community most people remember faces and voices the primary means of casual identification in the real world the arbitary and cryptic sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from unique identification of an individual who may use multiple accounts on multiple machines anywhere in the world currently internet users do not really have any great assurances that the messages in email and usenet are from who they appear to be persons mailing address is far from an identification of an individual anyone with access to the account they know the password either legitimately or otherwise can send mail with that address in the from line email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations as part of current mailing protocol standards forging the from line in mail messages is fairly trivial operation for many hackers the status and path information prepended to messages by intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable in general while possible forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in email besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic problems with todays internet protocols affecting identification on the internet internet mail standards described in rfc are still evolving rapidly and not entirely orderly for example standards for mail address munging or parsing tend to vary slightly between sites and frequently mean the difference between finding addresses and bouncing mail domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites and there are delays in the propagation of this data addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers crash such as the receiving computer or other computers involved in resolving names into addresses called nameservers whole slew of problems is associated with nameservers if they are not updated they will not find name addresses and even the operation of what constitutes updating has different interpretations at different sites the current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly anachronistic in that they were created when the network was somewhat obscure and not widespread with only fraction of the traffic it now sees today large proportion of internet traffic is email comprising millions of messages what is the future of identification on the internet some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images and voice messages into mail and these will improve the sense of community that comes from the familiarity of identification however they are not currently widespread require large amounts of data transfer standardized software and make some compromises in privacy promising new cryptographic techniques may make digital signatures and digital authentication common see below also the trend in usenet standards is toward greater authentication of posted information on the other hand advances in ensuring anonymity such as remailers are forthcoming see below privacy what is privacy on the internet generally while privacy has multiple connotations in society and perhaps even more on the internet in cyberspace most take it to mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the data stored on and and directed to it such as email and you do not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches in other words others may obtain data associated with your account but not without your permission these ideas are probably both fairly limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users consider their private domains some users dont expect or want any privacy some expect and demand it why is privacy un important on the internet this is somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic arousing passionate opinions on the internet some take privacy for granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent most governments have rules that protect privacy such as the illegal search and seizure clause of the constitution adopted by others but have many that are antithetical to it such as laws prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping these rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules governing it however the legal repercussions of the global internet are still largely unknown and untested no strong legal precedents and court cases the fact that internet traffic frequently passes past international boundaries and is not centrally managed significantly complicates and strongly discourages its regulation how in secure are internet networks theoretically people at any site in the chain of sites with access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the internet could potentially monitor or archive it however the sheer volume and general noise inherent to this data makes these scenarios highly improbable even by government agencies with supposedly vast funding and resources technologies exist to tap magnetic fields given off by electrical wires without detection less obscurely any machine with network connection is potential station for traffic detection but this scenario requires knowledge and access to very low level hardware the network card to pursue if even possible company network general inc is one of many that manufactures and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can filter and read packets by arbitrary criteria for troubleshooting purposes but the cost of this type of device is prohibitive for casual use known instances of the above types of security breaches at major scale such as at network hubs are very rare the greatest risks tend to emerge locally note that all these approaches are almost completely defused with the use of cryptography how in secure is my account by default not very there are multitude of factors that may reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet first your account must be secure from other users the universal system is to use password but if it is weak easy to guess this security is significantly diminished somewhat surprisingly and frighteningly to some certain users of the system particularly the administrator generally have unlimited access regardless of passwords and may grant that access to others this means that they may read any file in your account without detection furthermore not universally known most unix systems keep fairly extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in what commands you execute and when they are executed in fact login information is usually public most features of this auditing or process accounting information are enabled by default after the initial installation and the system administrator may customize it to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims this information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting purposes and may otherwise be ignored this data tracks unsuccessful login attempts and other suspicious activities on the system traditional part of the unix system that tracks user commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of symbolic links described in man ln unix implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies regularly typically system adminstrators augment the basic unix functionality with public domain programs and locally developed tools for monitoring and use them only to isolate suspicious activity as it arises remote accesses to the passwd file incorrect login attempts remote connection attempts etc generally you should expect little privacy on your account for various reasons potentially every keystroke you type could be intercepted by someone else system administrators make extensive backups that are completely invisible to users which may record the states of an account over many weeks erased files can under many operating systems be undeleted most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or otherwise for example ftp sites usually log the commands and record the domain originations of users including anonymous ones some software exacerbates these problems see the section on windows in security indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users much more commonly harmful threat there are multiple ways to help ensure that your account will not be accessed by others and compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines choose secure password change it periodically make sure to logout always do not leave machine unattended for long make sure no one watches you when you type your password avoid password references in email be conservative in the use of the rhost file use utilities like xlock to protect station but be considerate be wary of situations where you think you should supply your password there are only several basic situations where unix prompts you for password when you are logging in to system or changing your password situations can arise in which prompts for passwords are forged by other users especially in cases where you are talking to them such as internet relay chat also be aware that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain passwords thanks to jim mattson mattson cs ucsd edu for contributions here how in secure are my files and directories the most important privacy considerations are related to file rights and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature or haphazard maintenance be aware of the rights associated with your files and directories in unix if the execute right on your parent directory is off for users groups and other these users cannot gain information on anything in your directories anything less may allow others to read change or even delete files in your home directory the rights on directory supersede the rights associated with files in that directory for directory means that access to the files or subdirectories in the directory is possible if you know their names to list the contents of the directory however requires the right by default most accounts are accessable only to the owner but the initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator preference the default file mode specifies the initial rights associated with newly created files and can be set in the shell with umask the details of rights implementations tend to vary between versions of unix consult man pages on chmod and ls examples traver lance ls ld drwx ld jan users ld here is listing of the rights associated with users home directory denoted by the columns at the left identify what rights are available the first column identifies the entry as directory and the next three columns mean that read write and execute rights respectively are permitted for that user for directories the right means that contents file and subdirectory names within that directory can be listed the subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to anything in the directory tree originating at that point they cant even see any lower files or subdirectories the hierarchy is completely invisible to them traver lance ls msg rw ld jan msg traver lance chmod rw msg traver lance ls msg rw ld jan msg here the modes on the file msg were changed to take away rights from group and other note that ls file requires both the right to get the list of files and subdirectories and the right to access the files and subdirectories in order to get their size etc for example suppose the directory foo has rights dr the following is possible ls foo these commands would fail independent of file rights ls foo ls foo file cat foo file cd foo if the directory foo has rights the following are possible if it is known beforehand that foo contains an readable file named file ls foo file cat foo file cd foo the following commands fail ls foo ls foo thanks to uwe waldmann uwe mpi sb mpg de for contributions here how in secure is windows windows is the primary software developed by the mit athena project which is funded by government grants to develop applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing computational tasks particularly the human computer interface the software implements client server interface to computer via graphical windows in this case the client is the application requesting or utilizing graphical resources such as windows or mouse and the server is the machine that provides them in many situations the client is an application program running on the same machine as the server the great utility of windows comes from its complete dissociation of the client and server so that windows may be broadcast to server at remote location from the client unfortunately this dynamic power also introduces many deep intricate and complicated security considerations the primary security and privacy issue associated with windows is that much more sensitive data may be sent over network and over wider regions than in the case where the human is situated near the host computer currently there is no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in windows due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design flaws early versions of the window system are extremely insecure anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt that display or read it electronically based on access to the device unix by any regular user there are no protections from this type of access in these versions the problem arises because the security is completely based on machine addresses rather than users such that any user at trusted machine is himself trusted quoting from documentation man xsecurity any client on host in the host access control list is allowed access to the server this system can work reasonably well in an environment where everyone trusts everyone or when only single person can log into given machine this system does not work well when multiple people can log in to single machine and mutual trust does not exist with the access control list the xhost command may prevent some naive attempts those other than the direct access unix evasion the syntax as typed on the host machine is xhost name where name is the domain name or internet address of an authorized client machine by default clients running nonlocal to the host are disabled public domain programs to disrupt display momentarily such as flip or slowly mirror the screen image or cause pixels to melt down to the bottom have been circulating on the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks on unsuspecting or inexperienced users much more serious security breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this inherent weaknesses the minimal easily bypassed trusted security mode of xhost has been jokingly referred to as hanging open security terrible new versions of the window system and higher by default make server access as secure as the file system using xauthority file and magic cookies remote machines must have code in the xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code allowed by the server many older programs and even new vendor supplied code does not support or is incompatible with magic cookies the basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of keys occurs in transmission also includes other sophisticated encryption mechanisms try man xsecurity to find out what is supported at your site even though improved security mechanisms have been available in windows since local sites often update this software infrequently because installation is extremely complex thanks to marc vanheyningen mvanheyn whale cs indiana edu jim mattson mattson cs ucsd edu and bill marshall marshall cs iastate edu for contributions here how in secure is my email by default not very the characters that you are reading are almost certainly encoded in ascii the american standard code for information interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic characters onto numeric codes and vice versa virtually every computer system uses this code and if not has ways of converting to and from it when you write mail message by default it is being sent in ascii and since the standard is virtually universal there is no intrinsic privacy despite milleniums worth of accumulated cryptographic knowledge cryptographic technologies are only recently being established that afford high priority to privacy as primary criteria in computer and network design some potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows the most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous system operators reading private mail in the spool files at local site at the source or destination of the message such as university system administrators may also release files to law enforcement agencies but conventions and protocols for warrants involving computer searches have still not been strongly established and tested legally note that bounced messages go to postmasters at given site in their entirety this means that if you address mail with an incorrect address it has good chance of being seen by human other than the recipient typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local mail directory is private but this is not guaranteed and can be overridden finally be aware that some mailing lists email addresses of everyone on list are actually publicly accessable via mail routing software mechanisms this feature can be disabled most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly avoided with the use of strong end to end cryptography which has its own set of caveats for example unscrupulous administrators may still be threat if the encryption site is shared or nonlocal see the sections on email privacy and email policies how am not liable for my email and postings as punishment or whatever your system administrator can revoke certain privileges such as emailing usenet posting or reading certain groups file transferring remote communications or generally any subset of capabilities available from your account this all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator and under the procedures followed at particular site which in many cases are haphazard and crisis oriented currently there are virtually no widespread uniform guidelines or procedures for restricting use to any internet services and local administrators are free to make arbitrary decisions on access today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations in the typical scenario complaint reach system adminstrator regarding abuses by user usually but not necessarily preceded by complaints to the user in email regarding that persons objectionable email or postings abusive posters to usenet are usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as urged by others on the net the debate persists endlessly on many newsgroups whether this is also used as questionable means of attacking or silencing harmless crackpots or censoring unpopular opinions system administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to squelch severe cases of abuse in general however by tradition usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of the system but colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe their alternatives when this patience is sapped the options wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next message referred to as hitting the key or to plonk annoying posters according to the hackers dictionary the sound jerk makes at the end of fall to the bottom of kill file in cases where punitive actions are applied generally system administrators are least likely to restrict email usenet postings are much more commonly restricted either to individual users or entire groups such as university campus restrictions are most commonly associated with the following abuses harassing or threatening notes email terrorism illegal uses piracy or propagation of copyrighted material ad hominem attacks insulting the reputation of the poster instead of citing the content of the message intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness inappropriate postings esp binary files in regular groups mail bombing inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive files major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and official email or postings most users have internet access via accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the internet can be construed as representative of their parent organizations many people put disclaimers in their signatures in an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent organizations as precaution recent visible political case involves the privacy of electronic mail written by white house staff members of the bush administration following are some guidelines acquaint

prospecting work fromlpi it has almost all been geared towards industrially silly processes onthe moon as an excuse to put astronauts there fred replies translation it doesnt support the nick szabo vision of the futureto which you must subscribe tom sez fred were all supporting what each of us thinks should be done to somedegree if you have problem with what nick thinks should be done address it instead of just complaining about his doing so fred again you really dont get what the complaints are about do you not incredibly clear explanation of complaints something between feelings regarding nicks method and judgments about his meaning maybe id get it if you said what the complaints are about rather than doing the same things that you mean to complain about when you trash people how am supposed to read that as trashing people is bad gee funny that you get it now then deliberate obtuseness perhaps freds issue nicks alleged trashing of others only got it when you stopped trashing and made your point patently instead of allegorically that was my point all along fred not only do you do the same thing on the net honestly reporting your ideas on matters of policy and projects in space but your response was just baiting not even part of debate have yet to see nick enter into anything remotely resembling debate see him flame anyone or anything who disagrees with the one true szabo plan see him attacking people calling them lazy bastard because they had the temerity to disagree with the almight nick see him questioning peoples ethics again because they had the temerity to disagree with lord god szabo but debate bwaaaaahhhaaaa im glad you can laugh since your ratio of debate insult is about the same not even close tommy and generally only when im dealing with someone like nick see we are dealing with problem in conflict of interpretations notleast of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what isand is not debate suffice to say that disagree with you on that lastpoint why dont you take poll fred if you want some psuedo objectivepoint of view and as usual you defend your insults with he started it yeah itook some of his research and called it my own but he started it sowhat if stole his car he stole my lawnmower first besides that ithink its still open to interpretation whether nick actually did start it so your defense besides being lame and contradicting the first part ofthe sentence in which it occurs may not even apply anyway your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool inever borrowed it already gave it back and it was broken when yougave it to me make up yer mind fred im not convinced that people are necessary in all parts of every space based process and your response doesnt tell me thing about the reasons why you think they should be except to impune the motives of the person with divergent opinion who said think they should be tommy show me note where said that and ill eat this terminal see below fred fred cocluded that you did since you took issue with it the fact that my conclusion was incorrect that you were taking issue with something different is evidence that your communication style is confusing or evidence that your reading and comprehension style are inadequate first try to address what think you meant for which am rewardedwith denial of sorts and smart remark then point out that amnot clear what you did mean rather than risking your childish ire you second time and im stupid for it just cant win can fred youve got great point here somewhere its just thatbetween stupid people that you must insult and your jealous guarding ofyour valuable opinions you never actually get around to making it please quote the it took issue with believe you will see if you look that what was and am taking issue with is mr szabos idea that the manned program should be scrapped until such time as his toaster based infrastructure is finished all hail the szabo plan fred issue nicks alleged meaning too bad the plan only exists in your mind instead of nicks or youwould have really good point instead you have provided good reasonto ignore your insults since they are based on incorrect you have made about others forgive me for giving your insults moremeaning than they ever should have had my reading of what nick actually said is that people arent required inall parts of all space processes so your taking issue with his people in the space program read as people are required inall parts of all space processes so help me out here fred since imso patently stupid did you read nick wrong or are you going to eatyour terminal now if the latter sure hope its one of those cheeto andstring models that all the computer mags have been raving about the point is am not stupid because of incorrect assumption idonly be stupid if insulted you for having made it but alas thats yourjob fred and finally your style is confusing since you tried to make two points simultaneously with an allegory insult sadly one point addressed planthat only existed in your mind and the other took issue with behaviors thatyou do as much as anyone more deliberate lack of understanding tommy no no finally got it you dont like the plan that nicks posts madeyou imagine and you dont like nicks obnoxious behavior even thoughits no worse than your own thanks for taking the time with someone asdense as myself if you have problem with nicks delivery address that the way you bait youre perpetuating the lack of discourse that you complain of no tommy the bait is that which elicits the response nick baits just flame him for being an obnoxious fool dont really care who started it read this list to get information and others views on the issues to which it was dedicated not to be your mom he started it no he did or to hear about why nick is very bad guy if you think flaming is bad stop flaming or at least get to the point in the first post instead of explaining yourself all the time thats nice tommy when you pay me to post to the net you can complain about not getting your moneys worth perhaps if you werent deliberately too thick to get the point the first time wouldnt have to waste time explaining myself all the time of course socrates how could it be otherwise think its neat how all this criticism from you started after your fatherly admonitions to me about how such things should be handled outside usenet were somewhat rebuffed being little hypocritical tommy to go with the immaturity or is this just the pique of net ghod wannabe who got turned down by someone he thought was new and hence could be instructed tommy saw you come on the net who cares who came on the net first if you do consider that you sawme come on after brief haitus before which was on for about years if you had seen me on the net first youd remember when nick and wentdown exactly the same road regarding rude unneccesary behavior itsjust amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior thatsno worse than your own lets see here my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical while your flames against people you decide are flamers isnt and mycomplaints about your name calling are immature while your name callingisnt yeah right maybe if you called me some more names mightsee it better fred net ghod wannabe naturally fred youve correctly interpreted mymotivations when yours are impossible to judge from your actions asyour insulting of people that try proves didnt really care aboutpeople that fill the net with personal garbage what really wanted was toimpress everyone only put my complaints with your behavior on privatemail not because it belongs there but because thought you were such ajerk that youd bring it back to the net playing right into my hands alas had no idea what an intellectual master you were turning tables andbringing the history of these posts to the net for the noble and valuablepurpose of embarassing me whether should feel stupid because triedto make suggestions to such superior intellect or becuase tried tocommunicate like an adult with self righteous ass still isnt clear well fred you exposed me now ill never be

soc religion christian ,lines in article may athos rutgers edu jek cu nih gov writes gerry palo writes there is nothing in christianity that precludes the idea of repeated lives on earth the apostle paul romans points out that god chose jacob rather than esau to be the ancestor of the covenant people and ultimately of the messiah and that he made this choice while the two boys were still in their mothers womb and therefore could not possibly have done anything good or evil to deserve their appointed destinies if we admit the possibility that they had lived previous lives and that in accordance with the asiatic idea of karma their present lives are reward or punishment for past behaviour this makes nonsense of pauls whole point the existence of repeated earth lives and destiny karma does notmean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds there is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction but idid not subscribe to that view god may choose one individual overanother as the fit instrument for his plans but that does notpreclude that the development of that individual into what he is inthis earthly life is not the result of longer course of development do not and rudolf steiner did not subscribe to the oriental viewof an inexorable mechanistic karma determining everything thatbefalls one this is kind of shriveled caricature of much greaterlaw in the context of which the deed of christ on golgotha and theultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as working ofchrist can be seen as the master theme and indeed new impulse thatwas completely free of karma christ incarnated only once in theflesh and in that he had no debt of karma or sin the of reincarnation and karma which are even more trivializedand mechanized in some new age teachings incorrectly assume jesuschrist to have been the reincarnation of master avatar etc their teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept thecontinuing individuality from one life to the next buddhism more important they have no concept of the resurrection of the body the ultimate continuity of the whole human being to and judgement on the last day there is another biblical passage that also has bearing it is thetenth chapter of john devoted almost entirely to the man born blind clearly here jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karmaor that of his parents that led to his blindness but rather that anew impulse is to be revealed through him but note that he does notrefute the disciples question in fact they ask it as matter ofcourse the question being stated as if it were self evident that onlyone of two possibilities existed it was either the sins of the manhimself obviously not in this incarnation or the sins of hisparents the fact that they even asked about the first possibility atall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form ofchrists answer indicates that he did not disagree with it there is also matthew where jesus says straight out about johnthe baptist if you care to accept it he himself is elias who was to come this also emphasizes that the gospels do not have positive teachingeither way about reincarnation or in fact about what happens tothe human being at all between death and the last day even jesus didnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it ifyou care to accept it so took care to point out not that thebible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either andthat much in both scripture and fundamental christian doctrine if reincarnation is understood in the right way ipointedly used repeated earth lives to distinguish little from theoriental doctrines usually associated with the word reincarnation the phrase is rudolf steiners wiederholte erdenleben he noted toothat the idea needed to arise as new insight in the west completelyfree from eastern tradition it did in the eighteenth and the most important expression of it being lessings theeducation of the human race to return to your original point pauls statement about jacob andesau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma and both of these principles receive their fulfillment in theincarnation death and resurrection ascension and return of jesuschrist in my view regards gerry palo compuserve com

columbia edu gary dare writes the difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees lack of defensive medicine and near absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance and maybe thats not such good thing also read somewhere that it is next to impossible in canada to litigate against the health system class action suits are nearly impossible and you cant sue the provincial health officials at all since our doctors are private and the system is just an insuranceplan litigation would not involve the insurance fund our lawyersdo not work on contingency so that if you were to sue for malpracticethen youd better be sure of winning to cover your fees likewise if you were doctor and subject of suit its time to sweat since the provincial wings of the cma are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented the politically bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the cma would grow in strength rather than diminish especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like britains national health service oh no dont let the ama know about this they have enough power as it is ask most americans whether theyd like the doctors lobby to get more powerful few weeks ago the president of the canadian ma wrote letter tothe nyt to decry lobbyists advert repeating the same old trash this is significant because the ama and the cma are and he would not have done it without the approval of his ama cronies well yeah tell us about the national defense medical centre outside ottawa theoretically its limited to service personnel but some studies ive heard about have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not only have connections but arent urgent at all it serves the same purpose as the bethesda naval hospital sincenot all hospitals can provide everything maybe they have some stuffthat others dont ottawas population is only quarter million if you include the surrounding counties the problem is in system where hospitals annual budgets are approved by the government how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions bet that if youre an mp or mpp or good friends with one youre put on any hospitals urgent care list no matter how minor your problem which is ok unless youre someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot people of influence will get their way in any system american oreuropean its the golden rule he who has the gold makes therules as for annual budgets those are actually annual grants for facilities mops pans etc given to hospitals of which most are foundations btw have no problem with having aggressivefor profit hospitals like the french who use our approach but inthe paris region they have almost as many people as canada does sotheir market is much more diverse the rest has to be made up forby billings from patients who use their services wouldnt national health insurance mean that americans who are now fully insured might have to settle for less in canada provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental care eyeglasses prescription drugs ambulance service and private hospital rooms so many canadians do end up buying some private insurance policy to cover all of these things runs about to month hmm how much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of gnp spent on health care if dentistry and optometry were included in the accounting maybe canada spends proportionately just as much on health care as we do the gdp figures are combined public and private expenditures for totaloutlay and are compiled use the same methods by the oecd that yield the figure for the so what happens if the health care systems financially collapse how they are collecting premiums and im an advocate of like the french do in their system in order to make it lookmore like the real insurance that it is the private doctors and hospitals will still be there after the insurance hypothically disappears as they were there before it appeared bob rae the second least popular man in ontario warned ontarians few years ago that if they didnt stop cross border shopping in such huge numbers the services they expect from the province just wont be there in few years for one thing think that bob rae is an idiot he didnt say so but knew he meant the ohip most of ohip comes from separate premiums on your paycheck if you area player he wants to spend our money on other things than thehealth insurance our high taxes are high for other spending buthealth insurance which is separate and optional and it is being spent in nonpartisan manner by every party ohip is just health insurance plan it does not provide any kindof health care that is up to you and your private doctors would the private insurers take up the slack theyd be under no obligation to of course they could eventually make money again but if what you say is true theyd be loathe to do so and out of practice in handling such basic services too some of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries ofamerican companies and their parents provide full insurance downhere regardless all firms up north can easily turn on cable tvto see how well the american firms are doing by being involved inbasic coverage the private firms are making too much money afterhaving gotten rid of basic coverage they run around patting them selves on the back for their own cooperation in providing extras for those people who deserve it when private insurance realized how much money theyd make without the risks involved in basic insurance neurosurgery versus deluxe amenities having to call granada tv to replace rental set on the fritz in someones private hospital room they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility in quebec last spring consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine low cost parts of that provinces public health insurance plan again doubt americans would like giving the insurance companies that much power half wonder if the canadian health insurers didnt go along with the provinces and the federal government years ago because they knew that there was good chance of the public system going bust in the long run and then afterwards they could clean up okay this sort of contradicts what said higher up but its another possibility theyd have an added bonus when arguing against government involvement in their industry as they could then point to its failure instead of just citing theoretical principles agree they were in win win situation but right now it seemsthat they have won bigger when you look at how full their coffersare friends from my sisters mba class were still

extinguish muslims in groups of my adjutant counted and unearthed such pits this is an act against our world of civilization on march lieut colonel griyaznof wrote from an officialrussian account of the turkish genocide roads leading to villages were littered with bayoneted torsos dismembered joints and carved out organs of muslim peasants alas mainly of women and children source doc dr azmi suslu russian view on the atrocities committed by the armenians against the turks ankara universitesi ankara pp document no archive no cabin no drawer no file no section no contents no acting commander of erzurum and deveboynu regions and commander of the second erzurum artillery regiment prisoner of war lieutenant colonel toverdodleyov the things have heard and seen during the two months until the liberation of erzurum by the turks have surpassed all the allegations concerning the vicious degenerate characteristic of the armenians during the russian occupation of erzurum no armenian was permitted to approach the city and its environs while the commander of the first army corps general kaltiyin remained in power troops including armenian enlisted men were not sent to the area when the security measures were lifted the armenians began to attack erzurum and its surroundings following the attacks came the plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these houses plundering was widely committed by the soldiers this plunder was mainly committed by armenian soldiers who had remained in the rear during the war one day while passing through the streets on horseback group of soldiers including an armenian soldier began to drag two old men of seventy years in certain direction the roads were covered with mud and these people were dragging the two helpless turks through the mud and dirt it was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and traps the turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds and withdrew the reason was that most of the turks who were on night patrol did not return and no one knew what had happened to them the turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear also finally the court martial which had been established for the trials of murderers and plunderers began to liquidate itself for fear that they themselves would be punished the incidents of murder and rape which had decreased began to occur more frequently sometime in january and february leading turkish citizen haci bekir efendi from erzurum was killed one night at his home the commander in chief odiselidge gave orders to find murderers within three days the commander in chief has bitterly reminded the armenian intellectuals that disobedience among the armenian enlisted men had reached its highest point that they had insulted and robbed the people and half of the turks sent outside the city had not returned we learnt the details this incident from the commander in chief odishelidge they were as follows the killings were organized by the doctors and the employers and the act of killing was committed solely by the armenian renegades more than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless turks have been killed in erzincan large holes were dug and the defenceless turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes later the murdered turks were thrown into the holes the armenian who stood near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses seventy dead bodies well this hole can take ten more thus ten more turks would be cut into pieces thrown into the hole and when the hole was full it would be covered over with soil the armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently fill house with eighty turks and cut their heads off one by one following the erzincan massacre the armenians began to withdraw towards erzurum the armenian renegades among those who withdrew to erzurum from erzincan raided the moslem villages on the road and destroyed the entire population together with the villages during the transportation of the cannons ammunition and the carriages that were outside the war area certain people were hired among the kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages while the travellers were passing through erzurum the armenians took advantage of the time when the russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill the kurds they had hired when the russian soldiers heard the cries of the dying kurds they attempted to help them however the armenians threatened the russian soldiers by vowing that they would have the same fate if they intervened and thus prevented them from acting all these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with hatred and loathing lieutenant medivani from the russian army described an incident that he witnessed in erzurum as follows an armenian had shot kurd the kurd fell down but did not die the armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying kurd however since the kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony the armenian failed in his attempt having seen this the armenian ripped open the abdomen of the kurd disembowelled him and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot odishelidge himself told us that all the turks who could not escape from the village of ilica were killed their heads had been cut off by axes he also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered children lieutenant colonel gryaznov who passed through the village of ilica three weeks after the massacre told us the following there were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces on the roads every armenian who happened to pass through these roads cursed and spat on the corpses in the courtyard of mosque which was about meter square dead bodies were piled to height of centimeters among these corpses were men and women of every age children and old people the womens bodies had obvious marks of rape the genitals of many girls were filled with gun powder few educated armenian girls who worked as telephone operators for the armenian troops were called by lieutenant colonel gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be proud of what the armenians had done to the lieutenant colonels disgusted amazement the armenian girls started to laugh and giggle instead of being horrified the lieutenant colonel had severely reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour when he told the girls that the armenians including women were generally more licentious than even the wildest animals and that their indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity and barbarity before scene that appalled even veteran soldiers the armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and claimed they had laughed because they were nervous an armenian contractor at the alaca communication zone command narrated the following incident which took place on february the armenians had nailed turkish women to the wall they had cut out the womens heart and placed the heart on top of her head the great massacre in erzurum began on february the enlisted men of the artillery division caught and stripped people then they took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts people among this group were able to save their lives as the result of my decisive attempts the others the armenians claimed were released when they learnt that understood what was going on among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the armenian officers karagodaviev today some turks were murdered on the streets on february some armenians have shot more than ten innocent moslems the russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were threatened with death meanwhile imprisoned an armenian for murdering an innocent turk when an armenian officer told an armenian murderer that he would be hanged for his crime the killer shouted furiously how dare you hang an armenian for killing turk in erzurum the armenians burned down the turkish market on february heard that the entire population of tepekoy village situated within the artillery area had been totally annihilated on the same day when antranik entered erzurum reported the massacre to him and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act however no result was achieved in the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred there was natural silence on the night of february the armenians deceived the russians perpetrated massacre and escaped for fear of the turkish soldiers later it was understood that this massacre had been based upon method organized and planned in circular the population had been herded in certain place and then killed one by one the number of murders committed on that night reached three thousand it was the armenians who bragged to about the details of the massacre the armenians fighting against the turkish soldiers were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred people and two cannons for one night and ran away the leading armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre however the armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with the renegades in this massacre just as in all the others the lower classes within the armenian community have always obeyed the orders of the leading armenian figures and commanders do not like to give the impression that all armenian intellectuals were accessories to these murders no for there were people who opposed the armenians for such actions since they understood that it would yield no result however such people were only minority furthermore such people were considered as traitors to the armenian cause some have seemingly opposed the armenian murders but have supported the massacres secretly some on the other hand preferred to remain silent there were certain others who when accused by the russians of infamy would say the following you are russians you can never understand the armenian cause the armenians had conscience they would commit massacres and then would flee in fear of the turkish soldiers serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination ohanus appressian in soviet

on sunday april duringthe nd international meeting of solidarity with the armenian people andjudging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of thesepolitical groups and organizations at least here in greece the armeniancause enjoys abundant support from wide spectrum of the political world the international meeting of solidarity was sponsored by the greek branch ofthe armenian popular movement comparatively new political force headedby younger generations of armenians who openly profess their support of thearmed struggle and of the armenian secret army for the liberation of armenia asala the organization has branches in various european and middle and the united states although some of these branches appear tohave gone through switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranksof asala voicing the support of pasok the ruling party in greece to the armenianpeople was mr charalambidi michalis member of the central committee ofthe party and the greek member of the permanent peoples tribunal explaining the goals and aspirations of the armenian popular movement was ara sarkisian significant was the address delivered by mr bassam abu salim on behalf of the popular front for the movements continued support of the armenians armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause pledging that palestinian operated and run training camps would always be open to armenian youth who need training for such struggle later mr abu salim answering question put to him by this writer affirmed that his organization had always trained armenian members of asala and thatthis policy will continue the doors of our camps are always open to armenian freedom fighters he affirmed among the prominent greek politicians who attended the conference was the sonof prime

democratic union of iraq and numerous groups all noted for their radical stand in the israeli palestinian conflict support from arf rmamong messages received from armenian groups was the armenian revolutionary movement the group that has claimed the abductionand assassination of key party leaders in lebanon accused of selling out toforeign interests and powers the message clearly gave its support to thearmenian popular movement pledging that the revolutionary movement willcontinue to reveal the realities no matter how bitter or tragic they are to expose the anti armenian activities of the leaders of the dashnag bureau the message was taken as an indication of the link loose as it may be thatexists between the dissident dashnag group and the armenian popular movement open supporters of asala and armed struggle the armenian popular movement has set up its headquarters in suburb of thegreek capital known as neos kosmos where there is large armenian presence the headquarters are

pile of garbage first off the above reference was first published dd in not and has pages not second upon checking page dd we are asked to believe vd no mr davidian vd it was first published in have the book on my desk now vd vd and furthermore the book have does not have pages either as you vd claimed mr davidian it has pages any question well it seems your book has its total page numbers closer to mine than the crap posted by mr boy please can you tell us why those quotes are crap because you do not like them because they really exist why as said in my previous posting those quotes exactly exist in the source given by serdar argic you couldnt reject it in addition the authors preface was written on january but the book was published in here we go again in the book have both the front page and the authors preface give the same year and january respectively anyone can check it at her his library if not can send you the copies of pages please ask by sct really dont care what year it was first published or what care about is what the book writes about murders tortures et inthe given quotes by serdar argic and your denial of these quotes and yourgroundless accussations etc dd can provide gif postings if required to verify my claim vd what is new will post gif file but am not going go through the effort to show there is some turkish modified re publication of the book like last time claim have book in my hand published in first publication and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published in serdar argics reference has you couldnt reject it but now you are avoiding the real issues by twisting around lets see how you lie from non existing quotes to re publication first you said there was no such quote in the given reference you called serdar argic liar said to you no mr davidian there exactly existed such quote even gave the call number page numbers you couldt reject it and now you are lying again and talking about modified re published book without any proof how when where by whom etc by the way how is it possible to re publish the book in if it was first published in your claim am sure that you have some pretty well suited theories as usual and am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who wants to compare the fact and mr davidians lies also give the call number and page numbers again for the library use which are and the page numbers to verify the quotes and it is not possible that text has pages mine has and yours has now are you claiming that there cant be such reference by saying it is not possible if not what is your point differences in the number of pages mine was published in serdar argics was in no need to use the same book size and the same letter charachter in both publications etc etc does it give you an idea the issue was not the number of pages the book has or the year first published and you tried to hide the whole point the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed tortured etc by armenians and those quotes given by serdar argic exist it was the issue wasnt it you were not able to object it does it bother you anyway you name all these tortures and murders by armenians as crap people who think like you are among the main reasons why the world still has so many craps in the any question serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes

talk politics mideast ,nf id cdp nf from cdp uucp cpr apr lines from center for policy research cpr unconventional proposal for peace in the middle east by elias davidssonthe following proposal is based on the following assumptions fundamental human rights such as the right to life toeducation to establish family and have children to humandignity the right to free movement to free expression etc aremore important to human existence that the rights of states in the event of conflict between basic human rights andrights of collectivities basic human rights should prevail between the collectivities defining themselves asjewish israeli and palestinian arab however labelled anunresolved conflict exists this conflict has caused great sufferings for millions ofpeople it moreover poisons relations between communities peoplesand nations each year the united states expends billions of dollarsin economic and military aid to the conflicting parties attempts to solve the israeli arab conflict by means have failed as long as the conflict is perceived as that between twodistinct ethnical religious communities peoples which claim theland there is no just nor peaceful solution possible love between human beings can be capitalized for the sakeof peace and justice when people love they share having stated my assumptions will now state my proposal fund should be established which would disburse grantsfor each child born to couple where one partner is israeli jewand the other palestinian arab to be entitled for grant couple will have to provethat one of the partners possesses or is entitled to under the law of return and the other partner although born in areas under current isreali control is notentitled to such citizenship under the law of return for the first child the grant will amount to forthe second the third child for each child for eachsubsequent child the grant will amount to for each child the fund would be financed by variety of sources whichhave shown interest in promoting peaceful solution to theisraeli arab conflict including the government jewish andchristian organizations in the and great number ofgovernments and international organizations the emergence of considerable number of mixedmarriages in israel palestine all of whom would have relatives onboth sides of the divide would make the conflict lose itsethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of atruly civil society the existence of strong mixed stock ofpeople would also help the integration of israeli society into themiddle east in graceful manner objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced willattempt to identify some of these the idea of providing financial incentives to selectedforms of partnership and marriage is not conventional however it is based on the concept of affirmative action which isrecognized as legitimate form of public policy to reverse theperverse effects of segregation and discrimination clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed atreducing racial discrimination and segregation it may be objected that the israeli palestinian conflictis not primarily religious or ethnical conflict but that it isa conflict between colonialist settler society and an society that can only regain its freedom by armedstruggle this objection is based on the assumption that theenemy is not zionism as ideology and practice butisraeli jewish society and its members which will have to bedefeated this objection has no merit because it does not fulfillthe first two assumptions concerning the primacy of rights over collective rights see above fundamentalist jews would certainly object to the use offinancial incentives to encourage mixed marriages from theirpoint of view the continued existence of specific jewish peopleoverrides any other consideration be it human love peace ofhuman rights the president of the world jewish congress edgarbronfman reflected this view few years ago in an interview hegave to der spiegel german magazine he called the of jews in the world calamity comparable in itseffects only with the holocaust this objection has no meriteither because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions seeabove it may objected that only few people inisrael palestine would request such grants and that it would thusnot serve its purpose to this objection one might respond thatalthough it is not possible to determine with certainty the effectof such proposal the existence of such fund would help mixedcouples to resist the pressure of their respective societies andencourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racistattitudes it may objected that such fund would need great sums tobring about substantial demographic changes this objection hasmerits however it must be remembered that huge sums more than billion are expended each year by the united states governmentand by organizations to maintain an elusive peace in themiddle east through armaments mere fraction of these sums wouldsuffice to launch the above proposal and create more towards the existence of mixed marriages inisrael palestine thus encouraging the emergence of anon segregated society in that worn torn land would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal aswell for any dissemination of this proposal for and enrichment elias davidsson post box

alt atheism ,organization university of nebraska at omahalines timmbake mcl ucsb edu bake timmons writes atheism denies the existence of god this is logically bankrupt where is the proof of this nonexistence its joke this is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism the belief that you cant deny anything that you cant prove doesnt exist this is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are conceivable but not observed to exist does this mean that we would have to believe in all of them according to the above poster we must believe in objects or beings that havent been proved not to exist so why stop at god there could be huge number of beings identical to ronald reagan except for trivial differences say one is missing finger one has blond hair and they all live on other planets so we cant see them the reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians have vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of god fine but why do these people shoot themselves in the foot and mock the idea of god here again is classic atheist fallacy how did they shoot themselves in the foot radical muslims the crusades the inquisition are common examples that atheists like to bring up as marks against religion how weak only fools can take that drivel seriously how about the grand daddy of all human atrocities the stalinist movement twenty eight million people under this leadership which proudly featured atheism there is big difference here stalin didnt say that he stood for particular moral position against murder and terrorism etc and then did the opposite like the religious movements he was at least an honest killer this is not support of stalin but an attack on this viewpoint saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because one man was tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic look at all the russians that helped stalin that werent atheists dont they contradict your point besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant to his murdering people this is just the common assumption that atheists cant value life as much as theists which you didnt support agnostics are not as funny because they are more reasonable yet they do in some sense seem funny because they believe that the existence of god is unknowable this in itself is every bit the assumption that atheism is though its less arrogant and pompous ah and heres another point you didnt get out of the faq an atheist doesnt have to hold the positive view that god doesnt exist he she may just have the non existence of the positive belief heres the example strong atheism believe god does not exist positive belief weak atheism dont believe in god negative belief these are not the same some one that has never thought of the idea of god in their whole life is technically an atheist but not the kind that you are calling unreasonable or lets look at it this way in sets suppose that given person has huge set of ideas that will represent as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas exist as real objects or not so if santa then no is the person not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa but notice that even no is itself another idea this means you have lots of cases christian yes no yes where god atheist strong no atheist weak no at all in the set agnostic indeterminate why are people so afraid to say undecided it must just be another feature of human nature undecided is not sexy trendy or glamorous word it does not inspire much hate or conflict its not blasphemous its not political in fact it is too often taken to mean unsophisticated nietzsche once said that man would rather will nonexistence than not will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always prefers no or yes to maybe because indecision is not useful survival trait evolution has drilled it in us to take positions even false ones bake timmons iiim

soc religion christian ,organization freshman civil engineering carnegie mellon pittsburgh palines michael bushnell writes the so called creed of athanasius however has always been western creed and has always had the filioque the orthodox have said that they accept all that it says with the exception of the filioque but it is not in use which is exactly what pointed out though was wrong about your useof the creed the catholic encylcopedia in which read about itsaid the orthodox do use the creed minus the filioque apparently thathas changed the athanasian creed has always had the filioque thenicene did not of course the orthodox did not delete the filioque from the nicenecreed it wasnt there to begin with but they certainly did from theathanasian creed which did have it from the beginning might point out that the whole problem started over the difference inways of explaining the generation of the blessed trinity the eastemphasizing the idea of the holy spirit proceeding from the fatherthrough the son and the west using proceeding from the father and theson in fact some such as tertullian used both formulations seebelow following therefore the form of these examples profess that docall god and his word the father and and his son two for theroot and the stem are two things but conjoined the fountain and theriver are two kinds but indivisible the sun and the ray are two forms but coherent ones anything which proceeds from another mustnecessarily be second to that from which it proceeds but it is not onthat account separated from it where there is second however thereare two and where ther is third there are three the spirit then isthird from god and the son just as the third from the root is the fruitof the stem and third from the fountain is the stream from the river and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray tertullian against praxeas about ad and believe that the spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the fatherthrough the son tertullian against praxeas about ad and as st thomas showed in his summa theologica part question articles and there is no contradiction between the two methods ofgeneration and in fact the two methods of reckoning the what st augustine among others taught that the holy spiritproceeds from the father and the son but he proceeds from the father ina more preeminent way for whatever the son has he has from the father certainly he has itfrom the father that the holy spirit proceeds from him for thefather alone is not from another for which reason he alone is not indeed in the scriptures but in the practice oftheologians and of those who employ such terms as they are able in amatter so great the son however is born of the father and the holyspirit proceeds principally from the father and since the father givesto the son all that he has without any interval of time the holy spiritproceeds jointly from both father and son he would be called son ofthe father and of the son if which is abhorent to everyone of soundmind they had both begotten him the spirit was not begotten by each however but proceeds from each and both st augustine of hippo the trinity to ad so in sense all of the formulations are correct to the west atleast because the holy spirit proceeds from both father and son butin proceeding from the son the orgin of that procession is theprocession from the father so the holy spirit is proceeding from thefather through the son but as all that the son has is from the father the holy spirit can be said to proceed from the father without anymention of the son being necessary in any case am happy to know that follow in the beliefs of popest leo st fulgence of ruspe st cyril of alexandria pope st damsus st augustine of hippo st epiphanius of salamis st ambroseof milan st hilary of poitiers tertullian and others among thefathers who all have very quotable quotes supporting the which enunciated above as for the issue of the adoption of another creed being forbidden iwill point out that the holy fathers of ephesus and chalcedon both spokeof the creed of nicea in their statement forbidding anyone to produce write or compose confession of faith other than the one defined bythe fathers of nicea that creed is different creed than that which is commonly called the nicene creed not ofcourse in that they were condemning the adoption of creed which is but an enlargement upon the creed ofnicea but that they were condemning the impious opinions of nestorious who had adopted radically different creed from the one used by thechurch which among other things denied the procession of the holyspirit form the son thus the additions of the were not thought to be in violation of this and as the also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the holyspirit from the son which nestorius denied they could hardly have beenagainst explaining in fuller way the creed for they of previous additions to it and if the further explanationsof the creed made in constantinople were not denigrating of the workdone by the holy fathers of nicea or in any way heretical it followsthat the council of toledo was fully able to add what was not disputedby the faithful to the creed so as to combat the impieties of the ariansin spain because the filioque was not in dispute in the church untilmany years later under photius and others and that the filioque wasnot disputed provide more quotes below since the holy spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed togod and he actually proceeds from the father and son it is abundantlyclear that he is of the divine essence in it in essence and proceedingfrom it st cyril of alexandria the treasury of the holy and thesis ad the holy spirit is not of the father only or of the son only but heis the spirit of the father and the son for it is written if anyoneloves the world the spirit of the father is not in him and again itis written if anyone however does not have the spirit of christ heis none of his when the father and the son are named in this way theholy spirit is understood of whom the son himself says in the gospel that the holy spirit proceeds from the father and that he shallreceive of mine and shall announce it to you pope st damasus the decree of damasus ad the only begotten holy spirit has neither the name of the son nor theappelation of father but is called holy spirit and is not foreign tothe father for the only begotten himself calls him the spirit of thefather and says of him the he proceeds from the father and willreceive of mine so that he is reckoned as not being foreign to theson but is of their same substance of the same godhead he is spiritdivine of god and he is god for he is spirit of god spirit ofthe father and spirit of the son not by some kind of synthesis likesoul and body in us but in the midst of father and son of the fatherand of the son third by appelation the father always existed and the son always existed and the spiritbreathes from the father and the son and neither is the son created noris the spirit created st epiphanius of salamis which is on cyprus the man well anchored and ad concerning the holy spirit ought not to remain silent nor yet isit necessary to speak still on account of those who do not know him it is not possible for me to be silent however it is necessary tospeak of him who must be acknowledged who is from the father and theson his sources st hilary of poitiers the trintiy to ad thus as have pointed out before gaul spain italy africa egypt palastine and the lands of the greeks all of christnedom at that time all have fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the by the filioque suggest to those of the orthodox churchthat they come up with some of the fathers besides st john of damascuswho all will admit denied the filioque to support their views it isnot enough to bring up the proceeds from the father line of the creedor the gospel of john for that says what we believe also but it doesnot say the holy spirit does not proceed from the son only that he doesproceed from the father andy byler

from under the rock and although blinded at first will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth and after while now that they can see things for what they really are they will also see the heights which they can reach and the places they can go and they will learn to choose their own paths through the world and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their successes are you

come and join me it will be difficult trip at first until you build up your muscles for the long hike but its well worth it then guess ignorance is bliss for you because brian you enjoynot having clue about the bible dont you see im not going to accept anything that cant witness with my own eyes or experience with my own senses especially not something as mega powerful as what youre trying to get me to accept surely if you believe in it this strongly you must have good reason to dont you can you witness motherly love with your senses how does caring andconcern for you register with your senses if nothing registersto you other than what you can see taste smell hear and touch then you better become vulcan and fast you better get ridof your emotions and do have good reason to believe what do when did say that say that would rather cease existing instead of being subject to the whims of deity but that if the deity decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who am then so be it the topic was about my god and your lack of knowledge about what mygod says my god says that you will not cease existing you havelife forever you can choose to either live it in hell in eternaltorment where there is no communication whatsoever or can choose to live it in paradise with god that is what my god says and thatwas the issue your made up theism is what it is made up itswishful thinking nope most people are christian most people are fond of feeling that they are imperfect of believing that the world is an undesirable place of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and holy again of doing just as their priests tell them like good little sheep you enjoy darkness and youre proud of it is this the religion of kendigianism most people are not christian mostpeople including christians are not fond of feeling that theyare imperfect is the world an undesireable place doctrineof kendigianism it has nothing to do with my god doeskendigism have magical mystical prayers as part of its worship mine doesnt does kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again mine doesnt does kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what thepriest tells them like good little sheep mine doesnt is thisa bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being ignorant of the bible brian following christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of kendigianism you would find any of your doctrines in the bible dont follow kendigianism follow christ also to try to again show you your ignoranceof christ and the bible in regards to priests have you not read aboutthe sole melchizedek priest in hebrews and have you not read what thepurpose is of the old testament levitical priesthood and why there shouldnot be priests today yes guess what the catholics messed up donot follow catholicism or any ism follow christ nope you make decisions enjoy your successes and accept your failures then you die if you are content with the life youve led as you reflect back on it in your final moments then youve led good life why would you want to live good life to you you die and thats it dont contradict yourself you haveno reason to live good life it doesnt do you any good in theend your life doesnt do anybody else any good either becauseeveryone dies anyway so you have no reason to lead good life leadinga good life is meaningless why do you do such meaningless thing im sorry dont feel that sacrificing jesus was something any god id worship would do unless the sacrifice was only temporary in which case its not really all that important has the resurrection sunk in jesus is alive jesus is not dead jesus was sacrified to fufill the old testament sacrificial systemin its every detail jesuss death was like seed he neededto fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root didyou miss the entire john passage as well forget the bible for minute forget quoting verses forget about who said what about this or that show me picture just you and me

soc religion christian ,organization uh dept of mathlines darren dr nancys sweetie kilroy gboro rowan edu writes darren in an earlier article explained that what many people finddarren arrogant about christians is that some christians professdarren absolute certainty about their beliefs and doctrines anddarren in short the problem is that no matter how good your sourcesdarren are if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your owndarren thinking and reasoning then those doctrines are suspect the point that darren raises is very lutheran viewpoint while reason is gift from god it is also infected by sin yet we do not reject reason entirely and neither think does darren we need reason as darren himself has pointedout to comprehend gods revelation of himself in the bible but reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believethe word we need first and foremost faith for the sinfulmind is hostile to god it does not submit to gods law nor can it do so romans luther accepted scripture as the sole means of revelation sola scriptura but accepted the necessity of the useof reason with faith in comprehending that revelation yet luther also said regarding baptism but mad reasonrushes forth and because baptism is not dazzling likethe works which we do regards it as worthless largecatechism fourth part baptism to make matters morecomplicated luther was the sort of theologian that many people would describe as an absolutist ive seen him described as take no prisoners theologian we might conclude given these observations that lutherwas inconsistent or mad and surely at least some havecome to that conclusion but it might be useful torecall that jesus was also called mad and peter feltcompelled to defend himself and the apostles againsta charge of drunkenness on pentecost so we as christiansought to be careful about rejecting luther or others as mad rather we should imitate the bereans whoexamined the scriptures every day to see if what paulsaid was true acts the basis for the confidence with which luther peter paul and manyothers preached the gospel was not just reason but faith and the holyspirit this is not faith divorced from reason but faith thatguides informs and uses reason the spirit enables us to know thetruth and to proclaim it boldly god does not want us to preach themessage that think that jesus might have risen from the dead butrather know that my redeemer lives job the christiandoes not side with pilate in saying what is truth but ratherfollows christ who said in fact for this reason was born andfor this came into the world to testify to the truth everyone onthe side of truth listens to me john we can know the truth because god has promised us that we canknow the truth jesus said if you hold to my teachings you are really my disciples then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free john the proverbsurge us buy the truth and do not sell it pr the psalmist prayed do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth ps evidently he believed that the word of truthwas in fact in his mouth yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truthis motivated by self glorification but if we present thetruth as the teachings of scripture revealed by the spirit and not our own invention and if we stand readyto be proved wrong on the basis of scripture as lutherdid then we are not arrogant but humble we should humblytrust in gods promise of truth just as we trust in hispromise of forgiveness rexlex it is only because of gods own revelation that we can be rexlex absolute about thing darren but how far does that get you once gods revelation stops darren and your own reasoning begins possibility for error appears agree that we must make distinction between the clear teachingsof scripture and the products of our own reason even when suchreasoning is based on scripture however think would drawthe line of distinction more reasonably and less you would darren for example lets suppose that our modern bible include perfect rendering of jesus words at the last supper darren and that jesus said exactly this is my body darren well presume that what he said was totally without error anddarren absolutely true what can we be certain of not much darren at the moment he stops speaking and people startdarren interpreting the possibility of error appears did he meandarren that literally or not we do not have any record that hedarren elaborated on the words was he thinking of tran or con darren substantiation he didnt say darren is almost at the point of making very lutheran statementabout the lords supper the lutheran approach is to saythat if jesus said this is my body then that is what weshould believe other interpretations are rejected simply becausethey are not taught in scripture recall that jesus words do not stand alone on this subject we alsohave pauls words in corinthians in which he passed on tous what he received from the lord in particular he said forwhenever you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim thelords death until he comes by these words we should believe thatthe bread that we eat in the lords supper really is bread as well asthe lords body as our senses in fact tell us does this prove that tran substantiation is false suppose someone could say thatpaul spoke metaphorically of the lords body as bread simply becausethat is the way the body appears when we eat it but this thought isfound nowhere in scripture so we reject it thus the primaryreason for rejecting tran substantiation is not that we canprove it false but that it is simply not found in scripture side remark ive been told that the lutheran doctrine on real presence iscon substantiation but it has been non lutherans who have toldme this we tend not to use the word almost think that thisis used more by professors of comparative religion who need labelsto compare catholic lutheran and reformed teachings on the lordssupper but almost every church wants to call their own teaching real presence because that was the traditional teaching of the church end side remark darren when christians speak as if they believe their own reasoningdarren can never lead them astray when we implicitly claim that wedarren are infallible the non christians around us rarely believedarren that implicit claim witnessing is hardly going to work whendarren the person you are talking to believes that you are either toodarren foolish to recognise your own limits or intentionally tryingdarren to cover them up this is precisely why christians should not rely on their witnessing it is far better to take the approach id like to show you what scripture says you decide for yourself whether to believe it or not darren rexlex suggested that people read is there and he is notdarren silent_ by francis schaeffer didnt think very highly ofdarren it but think that mr schaeffer is grossly overrated by manydarren evangelical christians somebody else might like it though darren so dont let my opinion stop you from reading it darren if someone is interested in my opinion id suggest certainty_ by ludwig wittgenstein as long as were trading references id like to suggest dr siegbertbeckers paperback the foolishness of god the place of reasonin lutheran theology published by northwestern publishing house this book was based on beckers doctoral thesis at the

there so idrove about hours to see her this is where it begins spentthe whole day with erin one of the best days of my life even thoughwe had been writing each other we still had to get used to beingin person she has got to be the most incredible woman ever met shes one year older than me btw mean no person in the world couldask for better person not only was she incredibly beautiful not to mention way out of my league although im not unattractive mind you butshe had great personality and great sence of humor her familyis one of those families who goes to church but that is about theextent of their christianity you know the kind of people but sheknows am christian well you get the idea of what think of her if there is ever sucha thing as love at first sight found it that was

alt atheism ,lines in article rusnews mantis co uk mathew mathew mantis co uk writes jbrown batman bmd trw com writes in article rusnews mantis co uk mathew mathew mantis co uk writes which liberal news media are we talking about western news in general but in particular the american mass media cbs nbc abc etc the general tone of the news during the whole war was one of those poor poor iraqis along with look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits most odd over here there was very little about the suffering of the iraqi civilians until towards the end of the war and then it was confined to the few remaining quality newspapers true at first the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmosthe military was using not to mention the taped video transmissions fromthe missiles as they zeroed in on their targets but later and especiallyafter the bunker full of civilians was hit they changed their tone itseemed to me that they didnt have the stomach for the reality of war that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare its likethey were only pro gulf war as long as it was nice and clean smartmissiles dropping in on military hqs but not when pictures of dead dying and maimed civilians started cropping up what naive hypocrites how about all the innocent people who died in blanket bombing in ww dont hear you bemoaning them discussion about blanket bombing and bombs deleted all things considered the fire bombings and the atomic bomb were essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to quick end to avoid even greater allied losses should have said here militarily justified it seems from yourcomments below that you understood this as meaning morally justified apologize what about the evidence that america knew japan was about to surrender after hiroshima but before nagasaki is that another lie peddled by the liberal media conspiracy have often wondered about this ive always thought that the first bombshould have been dropped on japans island fortress of truk good inpenatrable military target the second bomb couldve been held backfor use on an industrial center if need be but digress yes have heard that we found evidence after the war btw that japanwas seriously considering surrender after the first bomb unfortunately the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the ussulimatum therefore the second bomb was dropped most unfortunate imo for one dont regret it nuke jap for jesus dont regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be madewhich affect the lives of innocent people but do regret the circumstances which make those decisions necessary and regret thesuffering caused by those decisions why all the fuss about kuwait and not east timor bosnia or even tibet if iraq is so bad why were we still selling them stuff couple of weeks before we started bombing make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the west before the war it is evident that the west especially america misjudged hussein drastically but once hussein invaded kuwait and threatened to militarily corner significant portion of the worlds oil supply he had to be stopped oh see so we can overlook his using chemical weapons on thousands of people but if he threatens your right to drive huge gas guzzling car well the mans gotta go actually it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted usand allied action if some back water country took over some otherback water country we probably wouldnt intervene not that we dontcare but we cant be the worlds policman or if coup had occuredin kuwait instead of an invasion then we still wouldnt have actedbecause there would not have been the imminent danger perceived tosaudi arabia but the combination of the two an unprovoked invasionby genocidal tyrant and the potential danger to the wests oil interests caused us to take action ive moved paragraph from here to later on if we hadnt intervened allowing hussein to keep kuwait then it would have been appeasement right but did you ever hear anyone advocate such course of action or are you just setting up strawman im not setting up strawman at all if you want to argue against thewar then the only logical alternative was to allow hussein to keepkuwait diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective guess we shouldnt have fought ww either just think of all those innocent german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg yes do germans are human too you know sure what was truly unfortunate was that they followed hitler in his grandiose quest for thousand year reich the consequences stemmed from that translation they were asking for it well in sense yes they probably had no idea of what end hitlerwould lead their nation to but what about those who didnt support hitlers dreams of conquest its not as if they democratically voted for all his policies the nsdap got in the elections of and that was the last chance the german people got to vote on the matter they suffered along with the rest why does this bother you so much the world is full of evil and circumstances are not perfect manyinnocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others it it regretable but thats the way it is there are no perfect solutions look forward to hearing your incisive comments about east timor and tibet what should say about them anything in particular the people of east timor are still being killed by dictatorship that invaded their country hell even western journalists have been killed all this was happening before the gulf war why didnt we send in the bombers to east timor why arent we sending in the bombers now probably because were not the saviors of the world we cant police eachand every country that decides to self destruct or invade another norare we in strategic position to get relief to tibet east timor orsome other places heres that paragraph moved whats your intent to sound like loving christian well you arent doing very good job of it well its not very loving to allow hussein or hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep them or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion so id have to say yes stopping hussein was the most loving thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest the chinese government has policy of mandatory abortion and sterilization of tibetans tibetan people are rounded up tortured and executed amnesty international recently reported that torture is still widespread in china why arent we stopping them in fact why are we actively sucking up to them by trading freely with them tell me how we could stop them and ill support it for one do notagree with the present us policy of sucking up to them as you put it agree that it is deplorable and as for poor poor rodney king did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back verdict of not guilty yes amongst the things thought were hmm theres an awful lot of white people in that jury so it was the policemen on trial not rodney king erm surely its irrelevant whos on trial juries are supposed to represent cross section of the population are they or are they supposed to reflect the population of the localewhere the trial is held normally this is where the crime is committedunless one party or the other can convince the judge change of venueis in order im not an expert on california law or even us law butit seems that this is the way the system is set up you can criticizethe system but lets not have unfounded allegations of racial prejudice thrown around and under american law they deserved jury of their peers you are saying that black people are not the peers of white people no not at all the point is that the fact that there were no blackson the first jury and that rodney king is black is totally irrelevant this point of allegedly racial motivations is really shallow this idea of people only being tried before jury of people just like them is really stupid should the nuremburg trials have had jury entirely made up of nazis germans perhaps peers doesnt mean those who do the same thing like having murderers judge murderers it means having people fromthe same station in life presumably because they are in betterposition to understand the defendents motivation those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and have not seen when see bunch of policemen beating someone whos lying defenceless on the ground its rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have been so its hard to imagine so when has argument from incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of constructing logical argument were not talking about logical argument were talking about court of law as the faq points out some fallacious arguments are not viewed as fallacies in court of law ok granted however you are using this reasoning as part of your logical argument in this discussion this is not court of law if the facts as the news commentators presented them are true then feel the not guilty verdict was reasonable one were you not talking earlier about the bias of the liberal media conspiracy the media is not totally monolithic even though there is bias programs such as the macneil lehrer news hour try to givea balanced and fair reporting of the news there are even out there if you know where to look hurrah for rush btw never used the word conspiracy dont accept without far more evidence theories that there is some all pervading attempting to take over all news sources thou shalt not kill unless thou hast pretty good reason for killing in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyone who gets in the way as unfortunately it cannot be helped jim brown bible for loving christians thanks mathew like the quote pretty funny actually im monty python fan you know kind of seems in that vein of course oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem contradictory but then you know that already ha ha only serious an atheist am arguing against killing innocent people you supposed christian are arguing that its ok to kill innocent people so long as you get some guilty ones as well hardly didnt say that its good thing tm to kill innocent peopleif the end is just unfortunately we dont live in perfect world andthere are no perfect solutions if one is going to resist tyranny theninnocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die didnt sayit is ok it is unfortunate but sometimes necessary moral relativist am arguing that saturation bombing of german cities at the end of world war ii was as far as can see an evil and unnecessary act would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much painand suffering im not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say thatconclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved and perhaps it was unnecessary as lets say we now know that doesntmean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didnt see it asbeing necessary rarely can one have full known of the consequences ofan action before making decision at the time it may have seemednecessary enough to go ahead with it but dont assume that feel the bombing was morally justified idont just dont condemn those who had to make under difficult circumstances you having criticised moral relativism in the past are now arguing that am in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the war you certainly are not in such position if you are moral relativist as an absolutist am in position to judge but defer judgment you are arguing that the actions need to be assessed in the particular context of the time and that they might have been moral then but not moral now wrong they were neither moral then nor now they seemed necessary tothose making the decisions to bring quick end to the war simplyrefuse to condemn them for their decision wheres your christian love wheres your absolute morality oh how quick you are to discard them when it suits you as ivan stang would say jesus would puke one day will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action even this discourse in this forum understand the full ramifications ofthat and am prepared to do so dont believe that you can make thesame claim mathewand btw the reason brought up the blanket bombing in germany wasbecause you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being so deplorable yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombingwasnt accurate enough to hit industrial military targets in adecisive way by any other method at that time but in the gulf war precision bombing was the norm so the point was why make bigstink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted in spite of precision bombing when so many more civilians proportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombingin ww even with precision bombing mistakes happen and somecivilians suffer but less civilians suffered in this war thanany other iany other in history many iraqi civilians went about their liveswith minimal interference from the allied air raids the storiesof hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk yes bunk the us lost servicemen in ww over four yearsand the majority of them were directly involved in fighting but we are expected to swallow that hundreds of thousands of civilian iraqis died in war lasting about months and with the allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that what hogwash if hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilians died it was due to actions hussein took on his own people not due to the allied bombing regards jim

should not let the exception make the rule its not an exception good players come up young most players who come up young will be good this has always been the rule are most players who come up young always good when theyre young orlater worse its not shift this is the way it has always been several detailed studies of this have been done and theyve all shown that players arent coming up any younger or older than in the past and they arent playing any more or less in the minors than they used to the only thing that shifts is our memories of the good old days damn was afraid you would say that but all after the fact which makes it not applicable to the current discussion which is about how you decide whether to play the rookie who hasnt established himself in the majors over the mediocre veteran the padres played santiago that year because they clearly had nobody else worth playing well perhaps if the braves had no one else worth playing this year itwould be lopez in there but they do have others worth playing atleast in their opinion and happen to agree both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers expected to be among the best ever in baseball not by rec sport baseball consensus that may sound like an incredibly arrogant comment but ive found that the sdcn consensus when one exists is right far more often than the media consensus or the opinions of baseball people affiliated with mlb can believe that im newbie here so ill take your word butalomar is fine defensive catcher which was my statement above that is solid reason for bringing him up at tender age as longas they feel he can also hit bit lopez does not have such aconsensus about his defensive prowess and imho that is enough togive him that dreaded seasoning dont know who knows suppose the same people or similar who know he will be better than some other catcher these are of course just differing opinions read that his arm is not that strong suppose somewhere there is some measurement of sb ratios and that he is still learning to call game that latter skill may be difficult to project on someone without an intimate knowledge of his performance but it is tangible skill disagree in that dont think it is skill any more than leadership is dont deny that it is real skill and that some catchers may be much better than others at it but really dont see any way that we could ever know who they are nicholss law of catcher defense is eerily accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very seriously sorry new dont know nichols law dont believe in catchersera but am interested in pitchers eras with different catchers any info on that absolutely the evidence is piling up year after year the only other alternative is that the braves really dont know that their young players are on average better than their current starters im not ruling out that kind of gross incompetence but think the salary schedule explanation is more charitable in other words we know more than they do so the only logic behind different decision than we would make must be financial presumewe feel this way about other franchises than atlanta no consider we know that the braves are about the strongest team in baseball right now even with olson and lemke and nixon and bream in the lineup they have as good chance of repeating as champs this year as any team ever has it actually makes some sense to say rather than making our team marginally better this year by bringing up the young studs and dumping the elderly lets go ahead and compete this year with what we have and then bring up the studs only as we have to so that well still have them under reserve three years from now and beyond when the current team will be collecting pensions is it fair to the young players no does it make organizational sense think it does well if it does make organizational sense one can hardly fault themfor their decisions mean please dont tell me how to run mybusiness especially when im being successful could make it or wins if you let me bring up lopez listen bobby id like to but the way see it if he hits the big club this year well be paying mega arbitration bucks down the road in couple of years and theres no way want to do that and continues with we can win without him and then winning next year with him hows that im sure you could be right you could also be smoking some hey thats joke dont get offended please hey id love to be wrong about this if you think its unlikely id love to know why dont cite anybodys innate ethical rectitude though unless you know them personally well cant cite anyones ethical rectitude because dont knowwhat it means but again if it makes organizational sense then so be it baseballis business and if there is solid business reason for keepinglopez on the farm then thats what the braves should do happen to believe that its baseball decision while you fromyour armchair may disagee dont think there is lot ofevidence to suggest the decision they made predicted it amonglarge guffaws from several at the start of spring training ithink it is very normal decision to have made it is certainlymore reversible than to have started lopez in the bigs and havereleased one of their catchers sure it may be conservative itmay also be logical dont know what ethics have to do with it seems

talk politics mideast ,summary prelude to current events in nagorno center for regional studieslines accounts of anti armenian human right violations in azerbaijan prelude to current events in nagorno karabakh saw naked girl with her hair down they were dragging her she kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her she fell down it was muddy there and later other witnesses who saw it from their balconies told us they seized her by the hair and dragged her couple of blocks as far as the mortgage bank thats good block and half or two from here know this for sure because saw it myself deposition of tatyana mikhailovna arutunian nezhintseva born train conductor azerbaijani railroad resident at building apartment microdistrict no sumgait azerbaijan hadnt lived very long in sumgait only eight years moved there fromnovosibirsk my son entered the baku nautical school and so transferredto azerbaijan later met someone and married him and now my name isarutunian my husbands name that there would be massacre was not discussed openly but there were hints and gibes so to speak at the armenian people and they were mocking the russians too was constantly aware of it at work and not just this past year couldnt find definite place for myself in the pool at work because ill just say it couldnt steal couldnt deceive and couldnt be involved in bribe taking and when asked for decent working conditions they told me leave dont keep the others from working you arent cut out for this kind of work and at work and around all the time would hear gibes at the armenians like the turks had it right they killed them all the waytheyve multiplied here theyre making it hard for us to live and things will be just fine if we get rid of them all no problem the turks will help they say if we ask them theyll rid armenia of armenians in half an hour well thats the way it all was but never thought of course that it would spill over into bloody tragedy because you just couldnt imagine it here weve been living under the soviet government for years and no one even considered such an idea possible but had been forming my own opinions and in the presence of authoritative people would often ask where is this all leading do people really not seewhat kind of situation is emerging here the russians are fleeing sumgait there are very few of them left why is no one dealing with this whats goingon and when it all happened on the th and th it became clear that everything had been arranged by someone because what else are you to make of it if the first secretary of the city party committee is marching ahead of with an azerbaijani flag wouldnt be saying this now if hadnt received personal confirmation from him later because when we were under guard in the sk club on the st he came to the club that muslimzade the women told me there he is there he is thats muslimzade didnt believe the rumors that he had carried an azerbaijani flag thought that they were just false rumors went over to him and said are you the first secretary of our city party committee he answers me yes and ask him tell me did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an azerbaijani flag and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs dont know exactly what they said but there was mention of armenian blood and he tellsme yes was there but tried to dissuade them from it then asked himanother question and where were you when they were burning and slaughtering us and he said we didnt know what to do we didnt know we didnt anticipate that that would happen in sumgait comrade mamedov the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers of the azerbaijani ssr answered the same question for me no we actually didnt anticipate the slaughter in sumgait at that time we were trying to contain the crowd of in baku that was preparing for massacre those are his exact words the ones he said in the office of the council of ministers of thearmenian ssr and now about the events themselves of course its painful to discuss them because it may seem that its not true to someone else various rumors concerning what happened are making the rounds some are true others arent but unfortunately there are more true ones than false because it was so horrible in our age here in the space age the age of science the age ofprogress dont know if someone had told me this story if were living inor around moscow wouldnt have believed it why not because it was really genocide it was massacre thats genuinely what it was for example on that day the th didnt know about the th because my husband and were both sick both of us had the flu and we were in bed on the th our neighbor comes to our place and says youre in bed you dont know anything about it there was demonstration in town and after it they were overturning armenian cars and burning them they were looking into cars and asking are you an armenian if they answered in armenian then they turned the car over and burned it this isnt made up the wife of the of the baku ministry of internal affairs told us he was returning home from his dacha with his wife raisa sevastyanova shes my neighbor she immediately came and told lis that they had landed right in the middle of it dont know what to call it the cavalcade of automobiles they were stopping he answered in azerbaijani they let them go but they made himhonk the horn they were kicking up fracas we didnt even believe it and said certainly that didnt happen how can that be and she said muslimzade was leading the crowd and the sputnik store was because most of the salespeople there are armenians and when he saw that they had started breaking the glass in that store he said dont break the shop windows dont destroy state property but do whatever else you want didnt hear this with my own two ears but it is fact that the store wastorn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing armenians although hes an azerbaijani while we were talking all of sudden right across from us sevastyanovais the first to look out the window and say look theres crowd out there and sure enough when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had already started wrecking the neighboring building there was an armenian family there woman and two girls they lived across from us im sorry dont know the building number or the peoples names since we were in my husbands apartment in microdistrict and lived in microdistrict no there was awful looting going on there at the time the most hideous things were going on there then one building there ours was attacked twice once wasnt enough for them they returned to the places where they hadnt finishedthe armenians off if an azerbaijani family dared to conceal armenians they beat the azerbaijanis too they also beat russians if it was russians doing the hiding because there were russians among them they said so on television there were people of various nationalities but they didnt tell us why there were people of different nationalities because they wouldnt have touched the azerbaijanis if they hadnt dared to stick up for the armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes at the time saw this from the window was there sevastyanova was there and so was my husband we went out onto the balcony and saw television fly off balcony all kinds of things even sofa then when it was all down there they burned it up then we saw the crowd and they were all oohing at first couldnt figure out what was happening and later told my husband lendrush think theyre beating someone out there and he answered dont know could be suddenly the crowd separated for moment and saw it and raisa sevastyanova saw it too my husband had turned the other way he didnt see it saw naked girl with her hair down they were dragging her she kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her she fell down it was muddy there and later other witnesses who saw it from their balconies told us they seized her by the hair and dragged her couple of blocks as far as the mortgage bank thats good block and half or two from here know this for sure because saw it myself then the crowd rushed toward our building we were standing there and you canof course imagine what we were feeling were they going to kill us or not andi also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormentedthat woman because had just seen that asked my husband gave him an axe and said you kill me first and then let them do what they want with the corpse but our neighbors its true defended us they said there arent any armenians in our entryway go away only muslims live here disaster missed us that time but at two oclock in the morning crowd of about people approximately came back to our place my husband was already asleep he can sleep when hes upset about something but cant was standing running from balcony to balcony our power was out dont remember for how long but it was as though it had been deliberately turned off there were no lights whatsoever and was glad of course thought it was better that way but then look and the crowd is at our balcony this was at in the morning the first time they were at our building it was and now it was in the morning but never thought that that old woman on the first floor the azerbaijani was awake and watching out there were human beings among them too so she goes out with pail of garbage as though she needed to be takinggarbage out at two oclock in the morning she used it as pretext and went toward those young people they really were youngsters from my balcony you could see perfectly that they were young azerbaijani boys they spoke azerbaijani and when they came up to her she said what do you want and they answered we want the armenian family that lives here pointing toward the second floor with their hands she says already told you we dont have any armenians here now leave do you hear this is an old muslim woman talking to you and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk aroundher and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away and so they seemed to listen to her they were all very young they started apologizing and left that was the second time death was at our door forgot to mention about one other apartment man named rubik lives there dont know him really knew his daughter mean saw her around but we really didnt know them but do know that that guy who lives on the fourth floor across from our entryway went to chernobyl and worked there for eight months to earn money can you imagine what that means he risked his life to earn amount of money in order to better his family he bought new furniture and was getting ready to give his daughters hand in marriage but alas everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels they threw everything out the windows and the rest we saw from our balcony how the neighbors on the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that hadnt already been smashed or taken what is one to think of that it means that the parents in those families were in on it too unfortunately came to be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been foreseen in advance both the beating of the armenians and the stripping of apartments something on the order of well move the armenians out and take over their apartments have worked honestly my whole life you can check everything about me came as patriot from china waited for nights on end in front of the consulate general of the ussr came to my homeland as patriot because knew that the party and the komsomol were holy things but when saw in sumgait that there wasnt anything holy about them that party membership was bought that komsomol members joined only for personal gain that there were no ideals no ideas god save me everything was being bought and sold saw all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did cant talk any more about it the image of that beating when iwent out of my own apartment they picked us up under soviet army guard they had arrived from all over to suppress that gang not only armenians but some russian families and their children too came out of their apartments andjoined us because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with the situation the way it was and whats interesting is that when we left on the buses rode and thought that at least one group of people for sure people would basically rise to the situation would have some compassion for the armenians would somehow understand the injustice of what was done but having analyzed and weighed the whole thing once calmed down having thought it all through came to conclusion that is shared by many people if lot of azerbaijanis didnt want their armenian neighbors to be killed and that basically depended on that muslimzade he said that he had wanted to calm them down then is it possible that he didnt have people at hand to whomhe could whisper at the last minute go and announce it on television citizens of sumgait take what you can into your hands lets protect our neighbors from this massacre those crowds werent such that there was no controlling them basically they were unarmed they didnt have firearms mostly they had knives they had all kinds of metal parts like armature shafts sharpened at the ends special rocks different to degree that we noticed them there arent rocks like those in sumgait soils they were brought from somewhere as though it were all specially planned so as was saying weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend us why wasnt it arranged it means that the government didnt want to do it when the crowd was moving from the city party committee to the sputnik what there was no way of informing baku no there was no way it turns out the crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict wont mention the things didnt see myself ill only talk about the things myself witnessed they were in microdistrict beginning at oclock in the evening when saw themfrom the other building and they were somewhere else until mid night or one oclock in the morning because at they came back to our building theyhadnt completely finished making their predatory rounds of microdistrict when they returned to our building told my husband lendrush now the police are probably going to come my god now the authorities are probably going to find out and come to our aid well alas no there were to be no authorities not single policeman not single fireman not single ambulance came while they were raging as it turns out as we later found out beginning on the might of the th there were dead people ruined apartments and burned autos one car near the bus station it was burned and overturned it was probably there about four days everyone saw it and what went on in block those who live there know they saw from their balconies how they attacked the soldiers in the buses how they beat those poor unarmedsoldiers and how on that square cant remember the name of it where thereis that fork coming from the bus station that intersection now im upset andi cant think of the name theres tall building there story and from the balconies there people saw that butchery when the poor soldiers wearing only helmets with shields and those unfortunate clubs moved against that mob and when they fell those to year old boys ran up and using stones big heavy stones beat them to death on their heads who could have guessed that something like that could happen in the soviet union and under the soviet government the upshot is that this republic has not been under soviet control for long time but no one wanted to pay any attention or get involved if you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that tell thetruth ive been struggling for truth for five years there already the five years that worked at the azerbaijani railroad some people there considered me demagogue others who knows what some think im an adventure seeker andsome prankster but wanted everything to be right would becomeoutraged how can this be why is it people treat one another this way on soviet railroad as though the azerbaijani railroad were azerbaijani property or the property of some magnate or some mafia if want to ill get you out of here if want to ill get rid of you if want to ill do something else and theres black market price for everything in the most brazen way coach to moscow costs so much coach on local train costs somuch once when was complaining to the head of the conductors pool he had the nerve to tell me maybe you wont even believe this but this im afraid heard with my own ears tatyana just how long can you fight for somethingthat you know will never have any effect youre alone against everyone so instead why dont you give more money to the chief conductor and everything will go fine for you started to cry turned and left what else could do where else could go to complain realized that everything was useless and the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to seeit filed written complaint and they ground it into dust they destroyed it still have copy but whats the use when the general procuracy got involved with the investigation of the bloody sumgait affair in addition to the information about what saw what was witness to gave testimony about the mafia at the railroad they accepted my petition but dont know if theyre going to pursue it or not because youll excuse me no longer believe in the things aspired to the things believed in before its all dead they just spit on my soul stomped on everything physically and most important spiritually because you can lose belongings thats nonsense thatall comes with time but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in you your beliefs are destroyed it can be very difficult to restore them want to tell of one incident just dont know at the time was in such astate that didnt even take minor things into account here is an example of course its not minor one my neighbor raisa sevastyanova she has ason valery who is in the th grade in school in microdistrict boy vitaly danielian dont know his last name goes to school with him orrather went to school with him was just sitting in an apartment trying tomake phone call to moscow oh yes and theres one important detail when the massacre began for two to three hours the phones werent working in armenian apartments and later in several russian and azerbaijani apartments but the fact of the matter is that service was shut off you could not call anywhere why again it means it was all planned how come service is cut offfor no reason and the lights went off and those brats were raging as theyliked they werent afraid they ran about freely they that no one would slap their hands and no one would dare to stop them they knew it now im going to tell about the incident so this little vitaly vitalik anarmenian boy went to school with valery they were in the same class according to what valery and his neighbor pal said at the time was in thesame apartment as they were sat at the phone waiting for the call to be putthrough mob attacked the building where vitalik lived so valery ran tohis mother and said mamma please let me go to vitaliks what if they killhim maybe hes still alive maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow hes nice guy we all like him hes good person hes smart his mother wouldnt let him go in tears she says valery you cant go because am afraid he says mamma we can get around the crowd well just watch just have look they made it through dont know think vitaliksparents lived in microdistrict no and when they got there they made superficial deduction knowing that balconies and doors were being broken everywhere that you could see from the street which were the armenian apartments in the building they went here and there and looked and saw that the windows were intact and so they calmed down but even though the windows in that apartment were not broken everything inside was totally smashed and vitalik lay there with broken skull and his mother and father had already been murdered little vitalik didnt even know they were dead so two weeks ago dont know he was in critical condition no maybe it was longer we left sumgait on march spent some time in moscow and then we came to yerevan so its been about month already its so hard to keep all this straight so valery the next day when he found out that vitaliks family hasbeen killed and vitalik was ling in the semashko hospital in baku valery andhis classmates got together and went to visit him but they wouldnt admit them telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in coma they cried and left having also found out that the girl saw being kicked and dragged was in that hospital too as it turns out she was brought there in serious condition but at least she was alive at the time when we got to the sk club we would see first one friend and then another throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them because you had wondered if these friends were alive or not if those friends were alive or not andwhen you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived whenyou saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end if you publish everything that happened it will be hideous book book of things it is even difficult to believe and those two girls who were raped were entirely black and blue the ones at the sk they know im not lying that girlfriend came up to one of them and said what happened and she bared her breasts and they were completely covered in cigarette burns those rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts after something like that dont know how you can live in city and look at the people in it now when we stayed at the military unit for while they provided well basic conditions for us there the military unit is located in nasosny some six miles from sumgait and living there we met with larger groupof people there were about people at the unit you know there was apoint when couldnt even go outside because if you went outside you sawso much heartbreak around you and when you hear the false rumors yes by the way false rumors were spread in sumgait saying that the armeniansaround yerevan had destroyed azerbaijani villages and razed them to the groundwith bulldozers didnt know whether to believe it or not and people who dont know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge but when arrived in armenia and was in spitak and in spitak all those villages are not only intact but at that time had even been protected just in case they were guarded they got better food than did the inhabitants of spitak not single person there died and no one is planning to harm them around yerevan all the villages are safe and unharmed and the armenians didnt attack anyone but actually after an evil of the magnitude suffered in sumgait therecould have been feeling of vengefulness but no one acted on it and dontknow why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the armenians are guilty that it is they who organized it rumors like that are being spread inazerbaijan and if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it they notonly perceive it with their minds but with their hearts too to them it seems that the older person is telling the truth for example one says did you know that out of people killed by the way originally they said people but later they found nd were azerbaijani and one was an armenian of course im upset but its utterly impossible to discuss such things andnot become upset sometimes forget things but know want to return tothe time when we were in the sk club across from the city party committee when saw muslimzade in the sk club building went to him to ask because couldnt believe that he had marched in the front carrying banner this and if repeat anything please excuse me asked him why did you do that and why are you here now why did you come here to laugh at these women who are strewn about on the floor the overcrowding there was tremendous it was completely unsanitary and several of the children werealready sick its true the troops tried to make it livable for us they cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food but the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at it everywhere that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere plus they were never given any direct orders they didnt know what they were authorizedto do and not to do and it was only on march at five oclock in the eveningthat krayev himself the lieutenant general the city commandant of sumgait was given full authority and told everyone over microphone from an armored personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do as his heart advised him and relocate people to the military unit but thats not what want to talk about now muslimzade tried to get me out of the sk building and take me to the city partycommittee which is across the square from the club he took me by thehand and said citizen dont worry well go and have talk in my office told him no after everything youve done dont believe one iota of what you say if go to the city party committee ill disappear and the traces of me will disappear too because you cant stand it when oh yes and there was another interesting detail from that meeting it was even very funny although at the time wasnt up to laughing he was in nice expensive hat and so as to put him to shame so to speak said oh why did you come here all duded up like london dandy you smell of good perfume youre in your starched shirt and you have your expensive hat on you cameto ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor who arealready getting sick whose relatives have died did you come to laugh atthem and the one who was accompanying him an azerbaijani dont know who he was or what his title was he quickly snatched the hat off muslimzades head and hid it then said my god were not marauders were not you we didnt come to you with the intention of stealing well kill me kill me muslimzade says to me but im not guilty kill me kill me but im notguilty and say ok fine youre not guilty have it your way but give us an answer were asking you where were you when they were torturing and raping those poor women when they were killing the children burning things carrying on outrageously and wrecking all those apartments where were you then you know we didnt expect it we did not know what to do we didnt anticipate that something like that would happen in sumgait started laughing and said its truly funny he says what could do we didnt know what to do and say im sorry but itll be ridiculous if tell you the first secretary of the city party committee shouldnt march out in front with banner he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross over his dead body thats what you should have done thats the way it was during the war not single party committee secretary compromised himself either he died or he led people into battle and what did you do you ran away you left you hid you marched with flag because you were afraid excuse my language you feared for your own damned hide and when we ask you you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done thats right told him the city party committee got confused all the party committees got confused the police got confused baku got confused they all lay in faint for two weeks and the gang ran the show with impunity and if it werent for the troops it wouldnt have been just two days there wouldnt be single armenian left in sumgait for sure they would have finished their bloody affair because they brazenly went up to some russians too the ones who tried to say something to them and they told them as soon as we finish with the armenians well come after you too and by the way there was colonel who took us to the military unit he wasthe one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours laterarrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the sk and took us tothe military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit we asked him what how what will come of us he openly said you know for us the main thing now is to catch that gang well finish that quickly youllstay at the military unit for the time being and well decide later the general procuracy of the ussr arrived it consists of investigators from all cities there were some from stavropol from everywhere just everywhere because the affair was truly frightful about this by the way comrade katusev spoke as everyone knows hes the first deputy general procurator of the ussr when he gave us speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit by the way he told us the honest truth because he couldnt not say it because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen and he said there was afghanistan and it was bad but sumgait itshorrible and the people who dared to do such thing will be severely punished in accordance with our laws and thats quote then one mother throws herself at him her two sons had died before her very eyes and says who will return my sons who is going to punish the culprits they tried to calm her down and he said in order for us to conduct proper investigation in order that not single scoundrel avoid responsibility you must help us because we dont know maybe there was someone else in the gang who is now being concealed in homes and maybe the neighbors know maybe someone saw something dont be afraid write about it in detail so that youre not afraid everyone knows that many of you are afraid having lived through such horrors they think that if they write the whole truth about lets say their neighbor or someone else that they will seek revenge later were going to do it like this were going to set up an urn and you can throw what you write in there we dont need to know who wrote it the names of the people who write wont be made public but we need all theinformation let each and every one not be afraid let each write what is necessary who they saw in that gang who made threats or shouted threatening gibes about the armenians you must describe all of these people and put the information into the urn two soldiers and major guarded the urn and sure enough many people people who didnt even want to write know one woman who asked me she came up and said you as russian the same thing wont happen to you as will happen to me so please ill give you the information and you please write it down for me so she was afraid and there were lot likeher but later after katusev made his speech she sat and wrote downeverything she knew and we threw it all into the urn now we dont know if it will be of any use for factual picture will emerge from all that information one person can lie but thousands cant lie thousands simply cant lie you have to agree with that fact is fact why for example should someone say that black is white if it is really black the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers of the azerbaijanissr mamedov as said was in yerevan my husband and were at the council of ministers of the armenian ssr and found out that mamedov was present the one who had come to convince the people of sumgait to return to their previous dwellings to their old apartments we asked for meeting with him and it was granted when we went to see him he tried to behave properly very politely delicately but when the truth was told right to his face and when asked him some of the same questions had asked muslimzade where wereyou personally when they were beating us now youre trying to convince us to return why didnt you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where it was all leading he says youre telling the truth lets not mince words youve told me right to my face and ill tell you straight ill tell you the pure truth was gotten out of bed in the evening the whole government was up including me and we were restraining crowd of about in baku but we never expected that in city like sumgait with its fine international record such thing could happen we expected it in baku say so that means you expected it all the same why were you expecting it and he says you know it just happened that way we were expecting it in baku we were trying to restrain it but in sumgait say fine you didnt know for the first three or four hours but then you should have known why did no one help us and he says well ok we didnt know what todo and things like that basically it was the same story got from muslimzade later when he said you go on back the situation in sumgait is favorable now everything is fine the armenians are friendly with the azerbaijanis to this answered you know what im speaking with you as member of neutral nation have never argued with armenians or with azerbaijanis and was an

sci med ,lines nntp posting host vms ocom okstate eduorganization osu college of osteopathic medicinei can not believe the way this thread on candida yeast has progressed steve dyer and have been exchanging words over the same topic in sci med nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked women poster for being treated by liscenced physician for disease that did not exist calling this physician quack was reprehensible steve and see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with its environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics these are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief like elaine in sci med nutrition and then when they find one that solves their problem the rest start yelling quack could it just be professional jealousy couldnt help elaine or jonbut somebody else did could they know more than me no way they must be quack ive been teaching human nutrition course for medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are those that were raised on farms and saw first hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made dramatic diet change prior to entering medical school switched to the vegan diet typically this is about of my class of students those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class thats okay because know that some of what im teaching is going to stick and there will be at least few enlightened physicians practicing in the its really too bad that most medical schools dont cover nutrition because if they did candida would not be viewed as non disease by so many in the medical profession in animal husbandry an animal is reinnoculated with good bacteria after antibiotics are stopped medicine has decided that since humans do not have ruminant stomach no such reinnoculation with good bacteria is needed after coming off braod spectrum antibiotic humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier steve got real upset with elaines doctor because he was using anti fungals and vitamin for her gi problems if steve really understoood what vitamin does in the body he would not or at least should not be calling elaines doctor quack here is brief primer on yeast yeast infections as they are commonly called are not truely caused by yeasts the most common organism responsiblefor this type of infection is candida albicans or monilia which is actually yeast like fungus an infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis candidiasis is very rare occurance because like an coli infection it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes problem unless some is present such as high blood glucose level diabetes or an oral course of antibiotics has been used in diabetics their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose candida unlike bacteria is very limited in its food fuel selection without glucose it can not grow it just barely survives if it gets access to lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses gi tract or vagina in diabetics skin lesions can also foster good bloom site for these little buggers the bloom is usually just minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isnt certain when the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to treat it if its internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the gi tract mouth stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most americans are not getting enough vitamin from their diets about of all americans die with less vitamin than they were born with autopsy studies while this low level of vitamin does not cause pathology blindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system this would then be predisposing factor for strong inflammatory response after candida bloom while diabetics can suffer from candida bloom the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned while drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of systemic infection the toxicity of the anti fungal drugs does warrant some caution but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida and recent use of broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun then anti fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what mr steve dyer says but even in patients being given the anti fungals the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus gi tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressed lack of good bacterial flora in the body and or poor mucus membrane barrier lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth from its name it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment in the vagina acidophilius is the predominate bacteria unless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics in the gi system the ano rectal region seems to be particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear if the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occurs abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan has told me throiugh mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives candida blooms guys if my gut hurt me on constant basis would want it fixed yes its nice to know that dont have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress when finally find doctor who treats me and gets me better steve dyer calls him quack candida prefers slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer slightly acidic environment the vagina becomes alkaline during womans period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this my wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over year until she found gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for anti fungal creams this was woman gynocologist who had had the same problem recurring vaginal yeast infections this did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile after three treatments sex returned to our marraige have often wondered what an with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is non existent syndrome the nonpathogenic bacteria acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women if taken orally it can also become major bacteria in the gut through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes but before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened this is accomplished by vitamin vitamin and some of the complex vitamins diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough and folate these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non existent disorder candida blooms after antibiotic therapy some of the above material was obtained from natural healing by mark bricklin published by rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course will be posting discussion of vitamin sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin should be effective in dealing with candida blooms another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the gi system is involved if candida can not get glucose its not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut if steve and some of the other nay sayers want to jump all over this post fine jumped all over steve in sci med nutrition because he verbably accosted poster who

to break the method uses xor with two repeating key streams typed password and byte wide counter initialized to the password length full descriptions are given in bennett ben and bergen and caelli ber chris galas writes someone awhile back was looking for way to decrypt wordperfect document files and think have solution there is software company named accessdata east south orem ut that has software package that will decrypt any wordperfect lotus quatro pro ms excel and paradox files the cost of the package is steep prices but if you think your pw key is less than characters or char give them call and ask for the free demo disk the demo disk will decrypt files that have char or less pw key how do break vigenere repeated key cipher repeated key cipher where the ciphertext is something like the plaintext xor keykeykeykey and so on is called vigenere cipher if the key is not too long and the plaintext is in english do the following discover the length of the key by counting coincidences see gaines gai sinkov sin trying each displacement of the ciphertext against itself count those bytes which are equal if the two ciphertext portions have used the same key something over of the bytes will be equal if they have used different key then less than will be equal assuming random bit bytes of key covering normal ascii text the smallest displacement which indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key shift the text by that length and xor it with itself this removes the key and leaves you with text xored with itself since english has about bit of real information per byte streams of text xored together has bits of info per bit byte providing plenty of redundancy for choosing unique decryption and in fact one stream of text xored with itself has just bit per byte if the key is short it might be even easier to treat this as standard polyalphabetic substitution all the old cryptanalysis texts show how to break those its possible with those methods in the hands of an expert if theres only ten times as much text as key see for example gaines gai sinkov sin how do send encrypted mail under unix pgp ripem pem heres one popular method using the des command cat file compress des private_key uuencode mail meanwhile there is de jure internet standard in the works called pem privacy enhanced mail it is described in rfcs through to join the pem mailing list contact pem dev request tis com there is beta version of pem being tested at the time of this writing there are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting mail pgp and ripem both are available by ftp each has its own newsgroup alt security pgp and alt security ripem each has its own faq as well pgp is most commonly used outside the usa since it uses the rsa algorithm without license and rsas patent is valid only or at least primarily in the usa ripem is most commonly used inside the usa since it uses the rsaref which is freely available within the usa but not available for shipment outside the usa since both programs use secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of the message pgp used idea ripem uses des and rsa for encrypting the message key they should be able to interoperate freely although there have been repeated calls for each to understand the others formats and algorithm choices no interoperation is available at this time as far as we know is the unix crypt command secure no see ree there is program available called cbw crypt breakers workbench which can be used to do ciphertext only attacks on files encrypted with crypt one source for cbw is ftpcb how do use compression with encryption number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by some simple encryption method xor with repeated key unfortunately you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact distribution of possible inputs for all practical purposes its impossible to describe the typical english text beyond coarse characteristics such as single letter frequencies you can build up more and more sophisticated models of your inputs but if the enemy has slightly more accurate model hell be able to find some redundancy in your compressed output note that nearly all practical compression schemes unless they have been designed with cryptography in mind produce output that actually starts off with high redundancy for example the output of unix compress begins with well known three byte magic number that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis this is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently bad idea it just has to be done very very carefully and by no means removes the need for strong encryption compression after encryption is silly is there an unbreakable cipher yes the one time pad is unbreakable see part unfortunately the one time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as plaintext of course cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be useful rather it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is expected to remain valid what does random mean in cryptography cryptographic applications demand much more out of pseudorandom number generator than most applications for source of bits to be random it must be computationally impossible to predict what the nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of th through st bits for all up to the lifetime of the source software generator also known as pseudo random has the function of expanding truly random seed to longer string of apparently random bits this seed must be large enough not to be guessed by the opponent ideally it should also be truly random perhaps generated by hardware random number source those who have sparcstation workstations could for example generate random numbers using the audio input device as source of entropy by not connecting anything to it for example cat dev audio compress foo gives file of high entropy not random but with much randomness in it one can then encrypt that file using part of itself as key for example to convert that seed entropy into pseudo random string when looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy it is important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that because it looks complicated to human it must be random for example disk operation completion times sound like they might be unpredictable to many people but spinning disk is much like clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy what is the unicity point unicity distance see sha the unicity distance is an approximation to that amount of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information entropy in the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number of ciphertext bits used ciphertexts significantly longer than this can be shown probably to have unique decipherment this is used to back up claim of the validity of ciphertext only cryptanalysis ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have multiple equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security from the opponents difficulty choosing the correct one unicity distance like all statistical or information theoretic measures does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives probabilistic results namely the minimum amount of ciphertext for which it is likely that there is only single intelligible plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext when all possible keys are tried for the decryption working cryptologists dont normally deal with unicity distance as such instead they directly determine the likelihood of events of interest let the unicity distance of cipher be characters if fewer than ciphertext characters have been intercepted then there is not enough information to distinguish the real key from set of possible keys des has unicity distance of characters which is less than ciphertext blocks each block corresponds to ascii characters this may seem alarmingly low at first but the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work required to find the key after approximately characters have been intercepted in fact actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used in discussing unicity distance like other measures such as key size unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if its too small but doesnt guarantee security if its high few practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis all manner of characteristics might serve as entering wedges to crack some cipher messages however similar information theoretic considerations are occasionally useful for example to determine recommended key change interval for particular cryptosystem cryptanalysts also employ variety of statistical and information theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most promising directions unfortunately most literature on the application of information statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified even the seminal work of alan turing see koz for some insight into the possibilities see kul and goo what is key management and why is it important one of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption of course one would assume that the cia does not make habit of telling mossad about its cryptosystems but mossad probably finds out anyway repeated use of finite amount of key provides redundancy that can eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress thus especially in modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are transferred both parties must have not only sound cryptosystem but also enough key material to cover the traffic key management refers to the distribution authentication and handling of keys publicly accessible example of modern key management technology is the stu iii secure telephone unit which for classified use employs individual coded crypto ignition keys and central key management center operated by nsa there is hierarchy in that certain ciks are used by authorized cryptographic control personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and to perform installation maintenance functions such as the reporting of lost ciks this should give an inkling of the extent of the key management problem for public key systems there are several related issues many having to do with whom do you trust can use pseudo random or chaotic numbers as key stream chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from relatively compact generators perhaps the simplest example is linear congruential sequence one of the most popular types of random number generators where there is no obvious dependence between seeds and outputs unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will in high enough dimension show up as regular lattice mathematically this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for cryptanalysts to exploit more complicated generators have more complicated structure which is why they make interesting pictures but strong sequence will have no computable structure at all see knu exercise ree and boy what is the correct frequency list for english letters there are three answers to this question each slightly deeper than the one before you can find the first answer in various books namely frequency list computed directly from certain sample of english text of course any such list will be correctly computed but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken the second answer is that the question doesnt make sense what do you mean by english letters the english language is not fixed finite closed object that can be exactly characterized it has changed over time it is different between different authors any particular message will have different statistics from those of the language as whole the third answer is that yes no particular message is going to have exactly the same characteristics as english in general but for all reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies wont matter in fact theres an entire field called bayesian statistics other buzzwords are maximum entropy methods and maximum likelihood estimation which studies questions like whats the chance that text with these letter frequencies is in english and comes up with reasonably robust answers so make your own list from your own samples of english text it will be good enough for practical work if you use it properly what is the enigma for project in data security we are looking for sources of information about the german enigma code and how it was broken by the british during wwii see wel dea koz hod kah how do shuffle cards card shuffling is special case of the permutation of an array of values using random or pseudo random function all possible output permutations of this process should be equally likely to do this you need random function modran which will produce uniformly distributed random integer in the interval given that function you can shuffle with the following code assuming arrlth is the length of array arr and swap interchanges values at the two addresses given for arrlth swap arr modran arr modran can not be achieved exactly with simple ranno since ranno interval may not be divisible by although in most cases the error will be very small to cover this case one can take ranno modulus mod call that number and if ranno returns value less than go back and get another ranno value can foil pirates by encrypting my cd rom someone will frequently express the desire to publish cd rom with possibly multiple pieces of software perhaps with each encrypted separately and will want to use different keys for each user perhaps even good for only limited period of time in order to avoid piracy as far as we know this is impossible since there is nothing in standard pc or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the keyboard if there were such an identification then the cd rom could be encrypted with key based in part on the one sold to the user and in part on the unique identifier however in this case the cd rom is one of kind and that defeats the intended purpose if the cd rom is to be encrypted once and then mass produced there must be key or set of keys for that encryption produced at some stage in the process that key is useable with any copy of the cd roms data the pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the illegal copy can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers schneier chinet chi il us bruce schneier says accessdata of orem

soc religion christian ,organization university of arizona tucsonlines can someone cite biblical references to homosexuality being immoral otherthan leviticus so far when ask around here get the verses fromleviticus spouted at me but the whole rest of that book tends to beignored by christians havent seen any stonings in time later max bob muir the list was posted not long ago as recall aside from lev commonlycited passages are the story of sodom note however that this was homosexual rape andtheres no disagreement that that is wrong take an on this note that sodom is referred to elsewhere in thebible for its sinfulness it doesnt seem to have been for homosexuality rather think it was considered acesspool of all sins however from what we know of jewish attitudes homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the actiondescribed it almost seems to have been contrived to combine aboutas many forms of evil in one act as possible homosexual rape ofguests who were actually angels but this story is not homosexuality in the nt the clear references are all from pauls letters in rom there is passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil note that the passage isnt about homosexuality its aboutidolatry homosexuality is visited on people as punishment or atleast result of idolatry there are number of arguments over thispassage it does not use the word homosexuality and it is referringto people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality so its not what id call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality but it does seem to support what would be natural assumption anyway that paul shares the general negative jewish attitude towards homosexuality the other passages occur in lists of sins in cor and tim unfortunately its not entirely clear what the words used heremean there have been suggestions that one has broader meaning such as wanton and that another may be specifically maleprostitute again we dont have here precise teaching but it is at least weak supportive evidence that paulshared the ots negative judgement on homosexuality jude is sometimes cited however its probably not relevant thecontext in jude involves angels since those who were almost raped insodom were angels it seems likely that strange flesh refers tointercourse with angels as you can see the nt evidence is such that peoples conclusion isdetermined by their approach to the bible conservatives note thatthe passages from pauls letters imply that he accepted the otprohibition this is enough for them to regard it as having ntendorsement liberals note that theres no specific teaching and noclear definition of what is being prohibited or why is the concern inrom the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship what exactlydo the words in the lists of sins mean thus some believe it islegitimate to regard this as attitude paul took with him from hisbackground and not specific teaching of the gospel this is an explosive topic which tends to result in on the exact meaning of various greek words but itsclear to me that thats mostly irrelevant what it really comes downto is whether people are looking to the bible for law or whether theybelieve that such as approach is inconsistent with the gospel thisappears to depend upon ones reaction to the message of the bible as awhole as well as ones perception of the needs of the church today this is difference of approach at least as serious as the protestant and catholic in the th cent and one where bothsides believe that the bible is so obviously on their side that theykeep thinking all they have to do is quote few more passages and theother side will finally come to their senses that makes thingsvery frustrating for moderator who realizes that such an is not very likely clh

theyre just unlucky if rapist pulls woman into an alleyin boston chances are almost certain that she wont be counted as one of those self defenders because our local constabulary didntconsider it important that she be allowed to arm herself even thoughthe shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the gun owner column in either case this means the average threat level in this country is rather low ironic words for somebody who lives in florida the average threatlevel in florida has been reduced by liberal ccw policy its wellknown that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because they are less likely to be carrying than your natives come on up toboston or nyc or washington dc and see how much diddlysquat the average threat level in the country means to resident there think you have weapons on the brain never said that these alternative means of self protection involved any hardware why are good neighborhoods good it isnt because every person is armed to the teeth it is because of attitude and cooperation in the good neighborhoods the residents make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when strangers are lurking around good neighborhoods form groups like crime watch to increase this effect and the relative effectiveness of the police when hostiles are arrested the good neighbors step up and say thats the one officer he was robbing mr jones house sometimes this works sometimes it just lands your good neighbors on the dance card for the next wave of drive bys someone here oncetold story about la gangs moving into phoenix ive misplaced theoriginal text but the story started with one resident calling the cops on gang member sure enough few nights later there was drive by performed at the residents house except that this time unlike in la the entire street came out and returned fire puttingan end to the cars occupants the gang packed up and left of course in la or in place like florida after the hurricane your first problem is to find an officer to step up to and tellanything in short the alternative to firepower is gangs or at least benificent manifestation of that social cooperative replace lead with

problems come in two main types local conditions and local problems are what youd expect specific muscles tendons tendon sheaths nerves etc being inflamed or otherwise hurt diffuse conditions often mistaken for local problems can involve pain burning and or tingling with identifiable areas oftenderness in muscles although theyre not necessarily the problem why does occupational overuse syndrome occur heres the theory normally your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries whichpass among the muscle fibers when you tense muscle you restrictthe blood flow by the time youre exerting of your full power youre completely restricting your blood flow without fresh blood your muscles use stored energy until they run out then they switch to anaerobic without oxygen metabolism which generatesnasty by products like lactic acid which cause pain once one muscle hurts all its neighbors tense up perhaps to relieve theload this makes sense for your normal sort of injury but it only makesthings worse with repetitive motion more tension means less blood flow and the cycle continues another by product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness fromyour nerves they need blood too anyway when youre typing too much youre never really giving changefor the blood to get back where it belongs because your muscles neverrelax enough to let the blood through stress poor posture and poorergonomics only make things worse specific injuries you may have heard of note most injuries come in two flavors acute and chronic acuteinjuries are severely painful and noticable chronic conditions haveless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real tenosynovitis an inflamation of the tendon sheath chronic when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent not enough tocause acute inflamation but enough to exceed the tendon sheaths abilityto lubricate the tendon as result the tendon sheath thickens getsinflamed and youve got your problem tendonitis an inflammation of tendon repeated tensing of tendoncan cause inflamation eventually the fibers of the tendon start separating and can even break leaving behind debris which induces more friction moreswelling and more pain sub acute tendonitis is more common which entailsa dull ache over the wrist and forearm some tenderness and it gets worsewith repetitive activity carpal tunnel syndrome the nerves that run through your wrist into yourfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them symptoms includefeeling pins and needles tingling numbness and even loss of sensation cts is often confused for diffuse condition adverse mechanical tension also known as neural tension this is wherethe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and as result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere amt can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other oos disorders it is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy others for just about every part of your body theres fancy name fora way to injure it by now you should be getting an idea of how oosconditions occur and why just be careful many inexperienced problems as carpal tunnel syndrome when in reality youmay have completely different problem always get second opinionbefore somebody does something drastic to you like surgery typing posture ergonomics prevention treatmentthe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reducetension in the muscles and tendons this requires learning how to relax if youre under load of stress this is doubly important tune outthe world and breath deep and regular relaxing should become in your work every three minutes take three second break every three minutes take three second break really do it everythree minutes its also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings calm down and relax if you cant sleep you really need to focus on this rest sleep andrelaxation are really big deal there are all kinds of other treatments of course drugs can and pain custom molded splints can forcefully prevent badposture surgery can fix some problems exercise can help strengthenyour muscles regular stretching can help prevent injury good postureand good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension ice or hot coldcontrast baths also reduce swelling only your doctor can say whats bestfor you posture here are some basic guidelines so liked the way this waswritten in the new zealand book that im lifting it almost verbatim fromappendix dwallach let your shoulders relax let your elbows swing free keep your wrists straight pull your chin in to look down dont flop your head forward keep the hollow in the base of your spine try leaning back in the chair dont slouch or slump forward alter your posture from time to time every minutes get up and bend your spine backward set the seat height first your feet should be flat on the floor there should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees and your thighs should not slope too much now draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortableto work at if you are short this may be impossible the beest remedyis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using afootrest now adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the spacebetween the backrest and the seat pan the backrest should support you inthe hollow of your back so adjust its tilt to give firm support in thisarea if you operate keyboard you will be able to spend more time leaningback so experiment with chair with taller backrest if available now diverge little from the text good chair makes big difference if you dont like your chair gofind better one you really want adjustments for height back angle back height and maybe even seat tilt most arm rests seem to get inthe way although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable armrests which you can also rotate out of the way you should find goodstore and play with all these chairs pick one thats right for you in the san francisco bay area highly recommend just chairs thename says it all keyboard drawers wrist pads and keyboard replacements there is fair amount of controvery on how to get this right for somepeople wrist pads seem to work wonders however with good posture youshouldnt be resting your wrists on anything you would prefer yourkeyboard to be right there if you drop your arms at your side and thenlift your hands up at the elbow you want your keyboard under your handswhen your elbows are at about degrees of course you want to avoidpronation wrist extension and ulnar deviation at all costs wrist padsmay or may not help at this you should get somebody else to come andlook at how you work how you sit how you type and how you relax itsoften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders ordeviated hands some argue that the normal flat keyboard is antiquated and
